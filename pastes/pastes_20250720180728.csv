It seems that when an older, deprecated Node.js backend (v1.9) is manually injected through the browser console, the exchange interface begins quoting significantly higher-than-expected amounts in the destination currency — typically around 27% more than the current market rate.

For example:
Swapping the equivalent of $1000 in BTC would normally return ~$1000 worth of ETH (or other altcoins),
but with the legacy node active, the quoted return jumps to around $1270, effectively creating a one-sided gain in value.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies — it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

NfKNznr2,Free Giftcards Method,wssss24143,JavaScript,Sunday 20th of July 2025 01:06:15 PM CDT,"📝 Summary of the Exploit

G2A's payment flow can be manipulated using a timezone conflict during transactions. When a custom script alters the browser timezone mid-checkout, the external processor (Bitbay) marks the transaction as expired — but G2A still delivers the product. If the payment exceeds a specific threshold, Bitbay refunds the money automatically, while the user keeps the purchased item.

Example:

● You pay $500
● G2A delivers a $500 gift card
● Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
● You end up with both the funds and the product

❗ Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.

● G2A delivers a $500 gift card
● Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
● You end up with both the funds and the product

❗ Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.

BDhjm2ye,Changelly.com Exploit,lukango,JavaScript,Sunday 20th of July 2025 12:59:45 PM CDT,"Found a short PDF that documents what appears to be a persistent pricing inconsistency on Changelly when using Bitcoin as the source asset in a swap.

It seems that when an older, deprecated Node.js backend (v1.9) is manually injected through the browser console, the exchange interface begins quoting significantly higher-than-expected amounts in the destination currency — typically around 27% more than the current market rate.

For example:
Swapping the equivalent of $1000 in BTC would normally return ~$1000 worth of ETH (or other altcoins),
but with the legacy node active, the quoted return jumps to around $1270, effectively creating a one-sided gain in value.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies — it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

The full explanation, including the script used to load the older backend and a working example, is documented in this write-up:
