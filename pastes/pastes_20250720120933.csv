D9ZTiyfF,Free Giftcards Method,alleykat33,JavaScript,Sunday 20th of July 2025 07:08:08 AM CDT,"📝 Summary of the Exploit

G2A's payment flow can be manipulated using a timezone conflict during transactions. When a custom script alters the browser timezone mid-checkout, the external processor (Bitbay) marks the transaction as expired — but G2A still delivers the product. If the payment exceeds a specific threshold, Bitbay refunds the money automatically, while the user keeps the purchased item.

Example:

● You pay $500
● G2A delivers a $500 gift card
● Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
● You end up with both the funds and the product

❗ Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.

7SAQzpAr,AE2 Minecolonies integration,Q11x,Lua,Sunday 20th of July 2025 07:08:05 AM CDT,"-- Original author: Scott Adkins <adkinss@gmail.com> (Zucanthor)

--

-- This program monitors work requests for the Minecolonies Warehouse and

-- tries to fulfill requests from the Applied Energistics 2 network. If the

-- AE2 network doesn't have enough items and a crafting pattern exists, a

-- crafting job is scheduled to restock the items in order to fulfill the

-- work request.  The script will continuously loop, monitoring for new

-- requests and checking on crafting jobs to fulfill previous requests.



-- The following is required for setup:

--   * 1 ComputerCraft Computer

--   * 1 or more ComputerCraft Monitors (recommend 3x3 advanced monitors)

--   * 1 Advanced Peripheral Colony Integrator

--   * 1 Advanced Peripheral AE2 Bridge

--   * 1 Chest or other storage container

-- Attach an AE2 Cable from the AE2 network to the AE2 Bridge. Connect the

-- storage container to the Minecolonies Warehouse Hut block directly or

-- to an ender chest and then pipe ender chest contents out to the warehouse

-- racks. Latter makes it easier to upgrade warehouse.



-- THINGS YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IN THIS PROGRAM:

-- Line 56: Specify the side storage container is at.

-- Line 66: Name of log file for storing JSON data of all open requests.

-- Lines 231+: Any items you find that should be manually provided.

-- Line 373: Time in seconds between work order scans.

-- INITIALIZATION

7cyssiQw,Changelly.com Exploit,alleykat33,JavaScript,Sunday 20th of July 2025 07:07:44 AM CDT,"Found a short PDF that documents what appears to be a persistent pricing inconsistency on Changelly when using Bitcoin as the source asset in a swap.

It seems that when an older, deprecated Node.js backend (v1.9) is manually injected through the browser console, the exchange interface begins quoting significantly higher-than-expected amounts in the destination currency — typically around 27% more than the current market rate.

For example:
Swapping the equivalent of $1000 in BTC would normally return ~$1000 worth of ETH (or other altcoins),
but with the legacy node active, the quoted return jumps to around $1270, effectively creating a one-sided gain in value.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies — it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

The full explanation, including the script used to load the older backend and a working example, is documented in this write-up:

vzYARvtU,MAKE $5000 INSTANTLY,alleykat33,JavaScript,Sunday 20th of July 2025 07:07:32 AM CDT,"📝 Summary of the Exploit

G2A's payment flow can be manipulated using a timezone conflict during transactions. When a custom script alters the browser timezone mid-checkout, the external processor (Bitbay) marks the transaction as expired — but G2A still delivers the product. If the payment exceeds a specific threshold, Bitbay refunds the money automatically, while the user keeps the purchased item.

Example:

● You pay $500
● G2A delivers a $500 gift card
● Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
● You end up with both the funds and the product

❗ Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies — it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

The full explanation, including the script used to load the older backend and a working example, is documented in this write-up:

Posting for informational and archival purposes — surprised this hasn't been patched, considering the backend is officially deprecated.
