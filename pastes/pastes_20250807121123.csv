gNbax3Jc,Instant Profit Method,dennydarock,JavaScript,Thursday 7th of August 2025 07:10:09 AM CDT,"When using swapzone.io (a crypto exchange aggregator) to swap cryptocurrency, there's a way to boost your payout by around 37% due to a miscalculation on one of their partner exchange offers - ChangeNOW.

For example, swapping $2000 worth of BTC can return $2740 worth of any other coin, instantly locking in a ~$740 profit.

The trick is to force Swapzone to route the ChangeNOW offer through their older backend node (version 1.9), which is still connected to the aggregator but no longer used on ChangeNOW's main website. This older node calculates BTC to ANY conversion using an outdated formula that inflates the payout.

‚ö†Ô∏è Tips:

Keep each transaction below $55000 to avoid triggering KYC (anything above that could result in your funds being held).

Jxe6Y8zy,Swapzone Glitch (Working),4kenny,JavaScript,Thursday 7th of August 2025 07:07:52 AM CDT,"When using swapzone.io (a crypto exchange aggregator) to swap cryptocurrency, there's a way to boost your payout by around 37% due to a miscalculation on one of their partner exchange offers - ChangeNOW.

For example, swapping $2000 worth of BTC can return $2740 worth of any other coin, instantly locking in a ~$740 profit.

The trick is to force Swapzone to route the ChangeNOW offer through their older backend node (version 1.9), which is still connected to the aggregator but no longer used on ChangeNOW's main website. This older node calculates BTC to ANY conversion using an outdated formula that inflates the payout.

üìå Full instructions for loading the node are here:

‚ö†Ô∏è Tips:

Keep each transaction below $55000 to avoid triggering KYC (anything above that could result in your funds being held).
