Sharing this technique based on my personal experience.
 
1. Use the time zone glitch to get free stuff:
 
Guide PDF: https://lc.cx/1nuuEU

The only version that works up to date 
 
2. Go to Paxful
3. Find buyers that buy them without physical receipt.
4. They pay about 60-70% of the codes value, normally u would say it's a bad deal, but since u got them for free u actually make easy and instant $$.
 
If u don't wanna sell them, u could actually just redeem them yourself, but personally I prefer to make money, but it's up to you.
 
Good luck!
