tydeligvis at noe går under det berømte bordet.

en sa til meg at sprøyter med små mg skal være gule og de 96 mg skal være grå..

har hørt at de grå består av tre komponenter.. kan bare gjette,, giftig ferrofluid,,amaricium 242,,buprenorphin.

så føler jeg har blitt forgiftet. var jo den første som begynte på buvidal.

og hvorfor lukter det så dritt av subutexen min..

noen sier det er kvinnelige kjønnshormoner i de...

kanskje derfor jeg blir så tjukk..
