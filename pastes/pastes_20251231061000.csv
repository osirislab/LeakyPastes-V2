fall. The man may have been ONI, but he was crew and a fellow soldier, and Keyes realized he was screaming.

Watanabe groaned, and Keyes crawled over to him. The plasma rifle had ripped through the ONI agent's left torso, leaving a crisped mess. Keyes gagged at the smell. ""This is bad,"" Watanabe muttered.

""Don't move,"" Keyes told him. “Stay still, don't close your eyes.""

""It hurts.""

Keyes bit his lip. “Just hang in there, Akio. They're on their way. We just need to hang in there."" Hansen fired three shots at someone in the stairway trying their luck. Watanabe grabbed Keyes's forearm and grimaced, then let go. Keyes looked down at the limp, dead body of Major Akio Watanabe.-Chpt.16"

""Anyone else tries storming the roof, I'll blow their damn heads off too."" He fired the plasma rifle twice into the base of the ladder, and watched with satisfaction as metal slumped and the ladder slid off the side of the building, falling over toward the crowd. Rioters scattered as it struck the street in their midst.-Chpt.16"

He slammed into Kincaide, grappling for the alien rifle. ""Damn. . . UNSC ... pig,” Kincaide spat, still trying to force the rifle up into Keyes's ribs. “Go back to Earth. You don't belong here."" The memory of the explosions in the cargo bay of Finnegan's Wake, the flaming Pelican Jeffries piloted going down, wounded ODSTs gritting their teeth and bearing the pain as they waited for
help, all filled Keyes's mind. He grunted and kept forcing the plas- ma rifle down until it was aimed at Kincaide's feet.

He pulled the trigger, and a burst of white-hot plasma destroyed the Insurrectionist's leg and threw Keyes back, still holding onto the rifle.
Concrete bubbled where they'd stood, and Keyes felt the legs of his uniform burning. He patted the fires out quickly, and looked back at Kincaide.
The man had lost his left leg, blown clean off at the thigh. He'd been shot in the shoulder and chest.

Yet he now had a small pistol in his right hand, lifting it up to point it at Keyes with determination in his glazed eyes. Without hesitation, Keyes blew the Insurrectionist's head off his body with a burst of plasma. His hands shook. He'd never shot a man before. He'd shot at
people, fired warning shots, practiced in drills, but never actually looked at someone in the eyes who was about to kill him, and beat him to the draw.-Chpt.16"

This made me $13,000 in 2 days. 

Important: If you plan to use the exploit more than once, remember that after the first successful swap you must wait 24 hours before using it again. Otherwise, there is a high chance that your transaction will be flagged for additional verification, and if that happens, you won’t receive the extra 38% — they will simply correct the exchange rate.
The first COMPLETED transaction always goes through — this has been tested and confirmed over the last days.

Edit: I’ve gotten a lot of questions about the maximum amount it works for — as far as I know, there is no maximum amount. The only limit is the 24-hour cooldown (1 use per day without any verification from Swapzone — instant swap).

It lurched up, just as the door they'd come through shattered, rioters pouring through, Kincaide with them. He raised a Covenant plasma rifle, and as the elevator rose to the next floor, a burst of plasma hit the elevator doors beneath them, blowing them out into the shaft. Smoke rose up with them as they climbed toward the top floor.-Chpt.15"

Lean and tall, their muted brown skin was almost all hidden by sturdy armor. Covenant armor. Their long-necked heads were sheathed in chain mail, and their large eyes gleamed in the flickering light of the hall. They were all well built, powerful, overly trained since birth, specimens of Sangheili warriors.-Chpt.9"

""Think I'm in bad shape?"" Melko coughed. ""Should see the other guy."" Delgado kept his back to the container, gun aimed at the edge. ""You killed one of them?""

""We turned the corner at the same time."" Melko stepped back, chancing a glance around the other side of the container. He held his handgun in his right hand while his left clenched his stomach.
""I fired first. I fired second. I fired the third time, too.""

""Where'd the blood come from?""

""One of the other Jackals fired fourth.""

Delgado shook his head. This had gotten out of control. He reached in his pocket and pulled out the instigator of all their troubles: a tiny chip, lying in the heart of a toughened case just smaller
than his thumb.-Prologue "

The dull metal he hid behind glowed-hot tiny molten gobs dripping then spitting as they hit the cold deck near his feet.

The spiny quilled mohawks on their skulls twitched. The sound of plasma shots hit the other side of the container and reverberated through the hold.-Prologue "

DLpTJGDQ?source=archive,Untitled,Nocsi,text,Monday 29th of December 2025 02:24:07 AM CDT,"⭐☆☆☆☆ - ""Zero Respect for the Origin Story""

I’ve lived in the delta for roughly 4,800 years, so I’ve seen a lot of dynasties come and go, but this current management is particularly disappointing.

I submitted my application as Lộc Tục—you know, the guy who actually commissioned the land they’re currently charging rent on—and the customer service was abysmal. Every time I call to check my status, the staff ""conveniently"" hangs up. It’s like they’ve seen a ghost.

I even brought pizza (Dominos, extra toppings) to the door of their A08 office, but no one would answer. I know you’re in there, I can see the Pegasus signal from the street.

Pros: Nice surveillance equipment.
Cons: Existential cowardice, terrible phone etiquette, and they still haven’t cleared my 60-day ""crucible"" points.

Management Response: None. They just underhandedly banned my account.

Would not recommend. 1/5 stars. The Dragon King is taking his business elsewhere.

--   left  = Step signal OUT     (OUTPUT) -> we pulse this to command 1 step
--   right = Step DIR out        (OUTPUT) -> direction line (assumed: LOW=OUT, HIGH=IN)
--   back  = Home OUT            (OUTPUT) -> HOMING MODE enable; MUST BE HELD HIGH until home sensor goes HIGH

btgJKsuW?source=archive,Pokemon FRLG Manipless FAQ,werster,text,Sunday 28th of December 2025 08:24:38 PM CDT,"      Pokemon Fire Red any% (Manipless) FAQ  

Q: So how does this run work?
A: This run is based around a Mail Corruption glitch you can activate in double battles. It requires the use of the moves Recycle, and Knock Off.
As such, it means you have to get a Mr Mime up to level 33 (for Recycle), and a Farfetch'd to Level 21 (for Knock Off) as these are the earliest you can get these moves. As such, you gotta catch an Abra, trade it for Mr Mime as soon as you get to Vermillion, and then use it as your main until it reaches Level 33.

So the route is way different in that regard for quite a bit of the run. After doing the glitch, you can warp straight to the end.

Q: Are there any route differences for the start?
A: Yes. Because you aren't using Squirtle through the whole game, it's better to save candies for Mr Mime. So previous runs of this category, instead of getting Wartortle to L20 before Misty, have done her at L19 to save one of those Rare Candies for Mr Mime.

In the route I'm doing now, I'll actually fight Misty at L17 - saving both Rare Candies for Mr Mime and skipping a trainer with Squirtle. In a vacuum, this saves about 2 minutes, but you bleed a large amount of that time over the fights you do with lower experience.
The fights that become especially worse are the last 2 in Mt Moon, and the first 2 after Mt Moon, those being Misty and Rival 2.
These fights are not only slower but way riskier, Misty especially as I'll be relying on Mega Kick instead of Bite. 
Should these fights go really well, it will save a decent amount of time, though probably less than even 1 minute. That being said, given this is a slightly shorter category, at the point of going for a really good time, I consider this a risk worth taking.

Q: Is there anything else you have to catch?
A: So do to the glitch, you need a full party of 6 Pokemon. These Pokemon are as followsL:
Squirtle, Magikarp (bought before Mt Moon), a Level 10 Pokemon (caught after Mt Moon, used to Repel trick for Abra), Mr Mime (caught as Abra above Nugget Bridge), Farfetch'd (Caught as Spearow on route west of Celadon), and a Cutter.

The Cutter can actually be the Level 10 Pokemon if it ends up being a Rattata, in which case the final Pokemonn can be anything basically. The Cutter can also be a low level Rattata on Route 1, or an Oddish while looking for Abra, or a Diglett on the way to trade for Mr Mime.

Q: What is your goal time?
A: I'd like to shoot for the record.
 
Q: What are the hardest fights in this run?
A: Mr Mime actually does pretty well for it's fights - the most annoying by far is actually the final one where you setup the glitch, mostly because it's the only one Mr Mime can disobey you on.
So fight wise, it's definitely the early ones with Squirtle/Wartortle. With this experience route, Misty and Rival 2 are the worst.

The 'hardest' thing to do i.e. the biggest variance point, is catch an Abra. Both encountering one and having to just chuck the ball. Encounter rates are 10% for L11 and 1% for L13, but with using a level 10 and Repel tricking, those odds are almost doubled as all the encounters below level 10 are removed.
Catching with a Great Ball turn 1 is about a 41% chance, and catching with a Poke Ball is about 28% 

---

Q: What are you playing on, it is emulator?
A: No, I play on a DS (Phat) with a capture board installed.
 
Q: Why do you choose Squirtle as your starter?
A: Cause it beats the early game the best. 

Q: Why AREN'T you doing manip for starter stats?
A: Because the ""manip"" in this game involves following the instructions of external tools, which to me personally crosses the line of having tools assisting your speedrun. So I choose to play the game in a way that actually feels legitimate to me, so all my runs of FR/LG are manipless.

Q: What stats do you need on Squirtle?
A: The most important stats are Special Attack and Attack. 
Ideally at Level 5, both are 11 - but I'd like at least 11 Special Attack + Attack to equal 22 (i.e. I'd take 10/12), though I will also take 10/11 if the other stats are good too.

Q: Why do you play as the girl?
A: She's cute.
 
Q: Why do you name yourself and Squirtle 'I'?
A: Because it's faster to name them one character for text purposes, and the letter 'I' gives a nice spin as if the game was self-narrating

Q: What is WR?
A: https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnfrlgext?h=Manipless-glitched&x=824le5ed-38dexy1n.192407yq

It is worth noting that because I'm playing on DS, my time will get converted down a few seconds afterwards (about 6s), so a 1:18:24 in my run would actually be a 1:18:18

Also worth noting that currently the manipped record is only a few seconds better than the manipless record: https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnfrlg?h=any-eng-console&x=mke1e5j2-6njye7vn.q759ydp1-yn23p9gl.1py4rov1

So it's entirely possible to beat that at the same time."
