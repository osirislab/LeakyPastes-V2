JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax
n JavaScript, you can keep a list of things using something called an array . An array is like a box that can hold many items . You can put different types of things in the box, like numbers, words, or even other boxes .

		// but it cannot delete them - it means some implementation
		// will always be available if we call it, compared to otherwise,

		//Shape shape = new Shape(""Square"");

		// (subtype) polymorphism, i.e. we write .getArea()
		// the interface is the same, but implementations are 
		// different and one is picked based on which object 
		// we have created; i.e. we use the reference of the
		// type Shape, but because it points to the instances 
		// of Square/Circle, the corresponding implementation
		// from Square/Circle are used, thus resulting in
		// polymorphic behaviour - same line has ""many forms"",
		// i.e. looks the same but acts differently`

		//System.out.println(shape.getArea());
		//System.out.println(square.getArea());
		//System.out.println(circle.getArea());
		
		// and now we demonstrate how we use Shape as 
		// an abstraction, leaving details for derived classes
		// avoiding switch or if/else statements and
		// the need to know the exhaustive list of all the 
		// subtypes; subtypes can be added later by writing
		// new classes, and the code does not need to know/change -
		// it will be handled by polymorphic behaviour

				list.add(new Circle(Math.abs(r.nextInt()%10)));
			} else {
				list.add(new Square(Math.abs(r.nextInt()%10)));
			}			
		}
		
		// and now we just sort, i.e. we use a comparator,
		// and the comparator calls getArea, and getArea used
		// depends on the specific object in question,
		// i.e. Square computes area differently than Circle;
		// and we don't care, we don't need to know, it is the
		// responsibility of the Square/Circle, and here we
		// care about something else, i.e. we need to sort and 
		// we don't need to know the details, we just say -
		// sort the list using AreaComparator, list is responsible
		// for storage, and the comparator is responsible for
		// order, and the .sort is responsible for the sorting
		// algorithm; those can change independently, and we don'temp
		// care because one does not need to know about the otherwise
		// - this is the essence of the principle of information hiding
		// which is the essence of what quality in the code means
		
		Collections.sort(list, new AreaComparator());
		
		// and now we print, again, getType is the same of all
		// and getArea is different depending on the object, but
		// the list does not know, thus we witness polymorphism 
		// again, in the full glory
