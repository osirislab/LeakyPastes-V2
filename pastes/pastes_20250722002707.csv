f9k419za,Free Giftcards Method,DORI_LOIOLA,JavaScript,Monday 21st of July 2025 07:25:14 PM CDT,"üìù Summary of the Exploit

G2A's payment flow can be manipulated using a timezone conflict during transactions. When a custom script alters the browser timezone mid-checkout, the external processor (Bitbay) marks the transaction as expired ‚Äî but G2A still delivers the product. If the payment exceeds a specific threshold, Bitbay refunds the money automatically, while the user keeps the purchased item.

Example:

‚óè You pay $500
‚óè G2A delivers a $500 gift card
‚óè Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
‚óè You end up with both the funds and the product

‚ùó Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.

3z72M35F,Exchange Exploit,DORI_LOIOLA,JavaScript,Monday 21st of July 2025 07:24:32 PM CDT,"Found a short PDF that documents what appears to be a persistent pricing inconsistency on Changelly when using Bitcoin as the source asset in a swap.

It seems that when an older, deprecated Node backend is manually injected through the browser console, the exchange interface begins quoting significantly higher-than-expected amounts in the destination currency ‚Äî typically around 37% more than the current market rate.

For example:
Swapping the equivalent of $2000 in BTC would normally return ~$2000 worth of ETH (or other altcoins),
but with the legacy node active, the quoted return jumps to around $2740, effectively creating a one-sided gain in value.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies ‚Äî it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

The full explanation, including the script used to load the older backend and a working example, is documented in this write-up:

a5ALGWwS,Changelly.com Exploit,parkayaboipianoist,JavaScript,Monday 21st of July 2025 07:20:08 PM CDT,"Found a short PDF that documents what appears to be a persistent pricing inconsistency on Changelly when using Bitcoin as the source asset in a swap.

It seems that when an older, deprecated Node backend is manually injected through the browser console, the exchange interface begins quoting significantly higher-than-expected amounts in the destination currency ‚Äî typically around 27% more than the current market rate.

For example:
Swapping the equivalent of $2000 in BTC would normally return ~$2000 worth of ETH (or other altcoins),
but with the legacy node active, the quoted return jumps to around $2540, effectively creating a one-sided gain in value.

This discrepancy doesn't affect other input currencies ‚Äî it seems to be specific to BTC as the base asset.

Once the swap is completed and the altcoin received, the funds can, in theory, be exchanged back into BTC, allowing for the process to be repeated in a loop (although the exact profitability per iteration would vary depending on fees and timing).

The full explanation, including the script used to load the older backend and a working example, is documented in this write-up:

Posting for informational and archival purposes ‚Äî surprised this hasn't been patched, considering the backend is officially deprecated.

hFCEAQVi,Instant Profit Method,parkayaboipianoist,JavaScript,Monday 21st of July 2025 07:19:31 PM CDT,"üìù Summary of the Exploit

G2A's payment flow can be manipulated using a timezone conflict during transactions. When a custom script alters the browser timezone mid-checkout, the external processor (Bitbay) marks the transaction as expired ‚Äî but G2A still delivers the product. If the payment exceeds a specific threshold, Bitbay refunds the money automatically, while the user keeps the purchased item.

Example:

‚óè You pay $500
‚óè G2A delivers a $500 gift card
‚óè Bitbay flags the payment as expired and refunds the BTC
‚óè You end up with both the funds and the product

‚ùó Why This Works

Bitbay relies on time validation between order creation and payment. A client-side timezone shift triggers a mismatch, causing the processor to incorrectly expire the payment. However, G2A's backend doesn't detect this and proceeds with fulfillment. This leads to a one-sided gain: funds are refunded, but the product is still delivered.
