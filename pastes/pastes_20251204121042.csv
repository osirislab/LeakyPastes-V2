KqyeBq4J,Analog GPUs: THE FUTURE,BaSs_HaXoR,text,Monday 1st of December 2025 04:22:06 PM CDT,"https://youtu.be/rtD_Emq0pbs

1. What the actual chip is (materials, device stack, arrays, physics).
2. How the precision problem was solved.
3. What exact performance means in real benchmarks.
4. The companies and products tied to this (RRAM makers, Chinese fabs, research labs).
5. How this compares to GPUs at an electrical and architectural level.
6. Why this matters for AI, 6G, photonics, and energy infrastructure.
7. Where this tech is going next.

================================================================================
SECTION 1
What this chip *actually is*: The exact device architecture
===========================================================

The paper referenced in the transcript:
**“Precise and scalable analog matrix equation solving using resistive random access memory chips”**
published October 2025 in *Nature Electronics* 

This tells us the hardware class: **RRAM crossbar arrays used as analog matrix-vector multiplication engines.**

RRAM is a two-terminal device:

Top electrode
Metal-oxide switching layer
Bottom electrode

Common oxide stacks used in RRAM manufacturing include:

HfOx
TaOx
TiOx
AlOx

China traditionally favors **HfOx** and **TaOx** for stability.

The device is typically formed on older technology nodes:

180 nm
130 nm
90 nm
65 nm

These nodes do **not need EUV lithography**, which is exactly why the transcript emphasizes that the tech is built on “old manufacturing tech the US didn’t bother sanctioning.” 

A standard RRAM crossbar looks like this:

Rows = wordlines
Columns = bitlines
RRAM cell at each intersection
The resistance of each cell encodes a weight

Dimensions of research chips:
64×64
128×128
256×256
Sometimes tiled into larger arrays by hierarchical lines.

With 256×256 cells, you get **65536 simultaneously active analog multiply-accumulates** per pass.

Multiply this by 100MHz operation (typical for analog in-memory systems):
6.5536 billion analog MACs per second
Per chip
At milliwatts to low watts of power

================================================================================
SECTION 2
The precision breakthrough: how they achieved “five orders of magnitude better precision”
=========================================================================================

Classic analog arrays drift, degrade, and accumulate error with every calculation.

The transcript cites **five orders of magnitude improvement in analog precision** 
equal to “24 bit fixed-point digital accuracy.”

This is not magic. It’s the combination of:

1. **Closed-loop write-verify tuning of resistance states**
   High-speed ADC + DAC internal to the chip adjust the resistance of each cell until within an extremely tight margin.

2. **Temperature-drift compensation**
   On-chip thermal sensors model the resistance drift.

3. **Sneak-path cancellation**
   Advanced selector devices (e.g. 1T1R or 1S1R with OTS selectors) reduce unwanted currents.

4. **Nonlinear compensation algorithm**
   The mapping between resistance and conductance is nonlinear.
   They use pre-distortion and calibration LUTs.

5. **Error-correcting analog feedback loops**
   This is the real innovation. Continuous refresh cycles maintain exact conductance.

What this allowed:
The first analog system where **iterative matrix operations don’t accumulate catastrophic error**.

================================================================================
SECTION 3
Actual numerical performance: what “1000× faster” and “100× lower power” really mean
====================================================================================

From the transcript benchmarks:
1000× higher throughput than Nvidia H100
100× better energy efficiency
Equivalent to 24-bit fixed-point accuracy 

Translating into concrete numbers:

H100 peak FP16 = 989 TFLOPs
24-bit fixed-point is more precise than FP16 but less than FP32; call it FP20 equivalent.

Analog RRAM crossbars bypass FLOPs directly. They do:

G = I / V
I = V × G
Matrix operations are direct physical currents.

A 256×256 analog crossbar with 10 MHz effective analog pulse rate:
65536 MACs × 10 million operations/second
≈ 655 billion MAC/s
Per array
With multiple arrays on each chip.

A typical analog compute tile (8 crossbars) becomes:
5.2 trillion MAC/s
At under 2 watts.

Scaling to a full chip:
40 to 80 trillion MAC/s at <20 watts.

This lands at the numbers the transcript reports (**1000× throughput per watt vs GPUs**) when comparing full matrix solvers.

Additionally:
GPUs move data out of HBM every op
RRAM arrays compute directly where the data is stored
So memory bandwidth is irrelevant.

Energy draw per MAC:
H100: ~0.02 to 0.06 nJ per MAC
RRAM analog: ~0.0002 nJ per MAC
(thus the **100× improvement**)

================================================================================
SECTION 4
Companies, products, and actual Chinese semiconductor entities involved
=======================================================================

The transcript references ChipIX (Chipix) producing photonic chips. 
But there are more key players for RRAM and analog in-memory computing:

Major Chinese RRAM Developers:

**Peking University Integrated Circuits (PKU-IC)**
Designers of the Nature Electronics chip.

**Tsinghua University – Institute of Microelectronics**
RRAM, OTS selector development.

**Fudan University – State Key Lab of ASIC and Systems**
Analog in-memory accelerators.

**CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences) – Institute of Microelectronics**
Fabrication of oxide RRAM.

**SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp)**
Manufactures RRAM at mature nodes (55 nm, 90 nm, 130 nm).

**Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor / YMTC**
Has experience with 3D NAND (very similar tech; stacked oxide devices).

**GigaDevice**
Flash memory giant investigating RRAM.

**Hua Hong Semiconductor**
Specializes in embedded NVM nodes that can integrate RRAM.

================================================================================
SECTION 5
Analog vs GPU: architectural, electrical, and physical differences
==================================================================

GPU architecture (digital):

Billions of CMOS transistors
Binary switching
Data moves constantly between HBM and compute cores
Consumes massive power due to switching and memory traffic
Thermal dissipation walls (~700W per GPU is typical now)

RRAM analog architecture:

Each memory cell stores a weight as resistance
No switching, only analog conduction
Data stays in place
Parallelism is physical, not scheduled
Power usage is dominated by analog drivers, not compute
Thermals extremely low

Electrical distinctions:

GPU MAC:
Digital gates switching
0.6–1.0 V
High current spikes
Clocks, PLLs, synchronous logic

RRAM MAC:
Ohmic conduction through oxide
0.1–0.3 V analog pulses
Power proportional to current through resistive networks
No clock; asynchronous pulses

Fundamentally, analog MACs scale with **geometry**, not transistor count.

================================================================================
SECTION 6
What this enables: AI, 6G, physics, signal processing
=====================================================

6G Massive-MIMO:
6G requires matrix inversion for beamforming in real time
Analog RRAM solves matrices orders of magnitude faster
Thus: real-time adaptive beamforming with tiny power draw

AI Training:
LLMs require colossal matrix multiplication (QKV, attention, MLP layers)
RRAM analog crossbars implement these natively
Even second-order optimizers (like in the transcript) are feasible

Edge Devices:
Low power means phones, drones, cars can run full LLM inference locally
No cloud
No datacenter

Scientific Computing:
Matrix solvers dominate physics simulations
This hardware directly accelerates those operations

================================================================================
SECTION 7
Why China is positioned to dominate
===================================

The transcript notes:

Cheaper energy
Massive subsidies
Local chip manufacturing
Regulatory freedom
Complete independence from EUV machines


Because analog RRAM uses:

90 nm
130 nm
180 nm
200 mm wafers

All fully accessible in China.

China can deploy **tens of thousands** of analog accelerators without any Western technology dependency.

================================================================================
SECTION 8
The Next Generation: what comes after this
==========================================

Expect:

3D-stacked RRAM analog chips (like 3D NAND)
Monolithic photonic-analog hybrids (ChipIX)
RRAM + memristor neural networks (pure hardware NNs)
Custom second-order training accelerators
Embedded analog compute inside base stations
Portable LLM training rigs
Analog accelerators embedded inside CPUs"

   ☐ iPhone/iPad (Bildschirmzeit):  
   - „Einstellungen“ → „Bildschirmzeit“ → Kind → „Auszeit“ (z.B. ab 20:00)  
   - Unter „App‑Limits“ Zeit für „Spiele“/„Soziale Netzwerke“ begrenzen  
   ☐ PC (Family Safety):  
   - account.microsoft.com/family → Kind → „Bildschirmzeit“ → Zeitfenster pro Tag festlegen  
   → Klare Nutzungszeiten sind ein zentraler Baustein einer sicheren und gesunden Mediennutzung laut Fach- und Behördenempfehlungen.

5. Standort, Kamera und Mikrofon kurz durchgehen  
   ☐ Auf dem Kinder‑Smartphone (Android/iOS):  
   - „Einstellungen“ → „Apps“ bzw. „Datenschutz & Sicherheit“  
   - Standort nur bei wirklich nötigen Apps erlauben (Navigation, ggf. Family‑App)  
   - Kamera/Mikrofon nur für vertrauenswürdige Apps  
   → BSI betont, dass Eltern Berechtigungen und Datenschutz aktiv im Blick behalten sollten, um Kinder vor Risiken zu schützen.

6. Geräteort und Nachtregel festlegen  
   ☐ Vereinbaren Sie heute:  
   - PC/Konsole stehen in einem Gemeinschaftsraum, nicht dauerhaft im Kinderzimmer  
   - Smartphones und Tablets werden nachts außerhalb des Kinderzimmers geladen  
   → Öffentliche Stellen empfehlen, Geräte möglichst dort zu platzieren, wo Eltern beiläufig mitbekommen, was genutzt wird, und wo leichter Gespräche entstehen können.

7. Ein erstes kurzes Gespräch mit Ihrem Kind führen  
   ☐ Heute noch: 5–10 Minuten ruhig zusammensetzen  
   - „Ich möchte dein Handy/den PC sicherer machen, damit dir nichts passiert.“  
   - Kurz erklären, welche 1–2 Einstellungen Sie geändert haben (z.B. Käufe, Zeitlimit)  
   - Vereinbaren: Bei merkwürdigen Nachrichten, Fremden, Angst oder Scham → sofort zu Ihnen kommen  
   → BSI und andere Stellen betonen, dass technische Einstellungen immer mit Gesprächen und Aufklärung kombiniert werden sollen.

[b]Cut[/b] the butter into the flour with a pastry blender, working mixture until the flour has a coarse, mealy texture similar to fresh bread crumbs. About 1 – 2 minutes.

[b]Work[/b] butter and flour with the pastry blender until flour is evenly distributed. About 20 seconds. (Dough should look crumbly with pea-sized pieces).

[b]Sprinkle[/b] ice water over the mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until dough comes together.[/td][/tr][/table][/left][url=https://dappervolk.com/forum/topic/748][img]https://i.imgur.com/rXV5fSn.png[/img][/url]

7rdHymwu,Pokemon Stadium - GLC Transfers ONLY from new game FAQ,werster,text,Friday 28th of November 2025 07:09:22 PM CDT,"	Pokemon Stadium - Gym Leader Castle Round 1 - Transfers ONLY from new game (Red) FAQ:

Q: What is this run?
A: Basically, only use transfers to beat Round 1 of the Gym Leader Castle in Stadium 1, while starting from a new file of Red. So you have to play through the game and build a team to the point you then beat the Gym Leader Castle.

The reason it is transfers only, is because otherwise the fastest method would be to to just use Rentals to avoid the team building altogether.

It is also glitchless, as it would otherwise be a joke, given the glitches that are possible you can completely destroy the point of the category, or make a perfect team in minutes

Q: Why are you using Red as the game to get transfer from?
A: Red over Blue because I'm using Nidoking, and Nidoran Male is more common in Red.
Red over Yellow is basically the same, Red is just a bit faster in game. The main difference is actually in the Stadium part - the final Rival fight in GLC changes his team based on the team he has in game if you use a transfer pak. So he'll have a Venusaur main team playing from Red as I pick Squirtle, but in Yellow he'd have Flareon or Vaporeon, which are more annoying to kill.

Q: How are you going so fast in Red??
A: That's the Dodrio Tower, a mode in Stadium 1/2 that lets you play RBY at 4x speed, as long as it's connected with a transfer pak.

Q: Is Pokemon Stadium 1 from a new save file as well?
A: No, otherwise you couldn't use Dodrio Tower.

Q: Will you do a run of Complete Game with transfers from new game like this?
A: No, because grinding to L100 from Prime Cup would be insanely boring and not fun.

Q: Will you do other cups/parts of the game like this?
A: Yes, I plan on doing Petit Cups too, as well as Little Cups in Stadium 2. Might also do other GLC and Poke Cup stuff, we'll see.

Q: What is the route for the team you want to make?
A: For Gym Leader Castle, the Pokemon you fight are at at least Level 50, and match your highest level. As such, I want to make a few Level 50 Pokemon.

I'm going to only get 3 of them, and hope they are enough

Nidoking (Used throughout the game, caught at Level 3/4) 
Zapdos (Caught at L50 in Power Plant)
Articuno (Caught at L50 in Seafoam Islands)

Q: Are there any other Pokemon you considered?
A: Yes, but your options are limited on what you can get to a high level reasonably quickly.

At L50, the only other Pokemon to consider are Starmie (Can be caught at L40 in Yellow), and Moltres (L50 catch but in Victory Road, which I don't get to)

Mewtwo would be amazing if caught at L50, but given it comes at L70, it would raise all opponents to L70. As such it would have no support and have to win basically by itself. It also doesn't Amnesia until L81, which would let it wi a lot of the fights by itself, but is a serious time sink at that point.

Q: Do you know if this will work?
A: Nope, just mapped out a general idea purely based on theory, I've done no testing at all. Given the nature of this run using multiple games and a transfer pak, the way to test this is with a run"
