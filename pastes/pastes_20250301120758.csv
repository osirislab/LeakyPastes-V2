FwmHJ8YZ,Image Upscaler For Text To Img Generators.,Jabber666,HTML,Friday 28th of February 2025 09:20:39 PM CDT,"Made by (perchance.org) User UFO (me) Using GPT-4. You're welcome. 
Working example. https://perchance.org/ufo-image-resizer-utility

Automatic image upscaler for text to image generators. 💜

<h5>How to instal into your image generator?</h>

First xD Make ""your"" image generator. 
In edit mode with new generator window open.
Look bottom right corner of screen for a ✨
Click the ✨ and select write new code. 

Tell it... 

""Create image editing site, add the ai image generator and 
configure it with the best possible settings, all render models 
known and apply the correct functions for the menu objects."" 

You may have to use another prompt after to add more elements to the 
menus but you might get a generous set of menu objects first time. 

Now that your image generator is working (should be), check menu items 
etc. Go back to the ✨ and tell it this (after pasting the below code). 

""Place a tick box next to the stable diffusion generator's (insert name 
of menu item in your generator you want this box next to).
When the image generator outputs it's image, if this box is ticked, off by default, 
instead use the settings from the upscale controls area effectsSelectEl, speedSelectEl, 
methodSelectEl and sizeSelectEl settings to automatically upscale the image from the 
image generator and put it back in the window it was supposed to load in when sent 
by the image generator.""  

If you/AI did it right you will see the generator actually appears to send the image to the upscaler 
where it is upscaled according to the scaling model/filter settings and outputs the upscaled image.

You may ned to try a few times to get this first time right. 
(OFC This assuming you know nothing about code and cannot just wisely do it yourself).

Enables automatic upscaling of your Stable Diffusion/Flux image generator. (400% for example).


Paste the below code into your html side in edit mode then follow above advice.

<div class=""container"" style=""max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"">
  <div class=""upload-section"" style=""margin-bottom: 20px;"">
    <div id=""dropAreaEl"" style=""border: 3px dashed #ccc; border-radius: 8px; padding: 30px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; transition: border-color 0.3s;"">
      <p>Drag & drop (not too many big ones maybe) images here or...<br>
      I am thinking it may be possible for Stable Diffusion to run<br>
      image generator through this upscale process automatically🤯</p>
