    ""desc"": ""   Khalid’s first military expedition under the Muslim banner was at Mu’ta (modern-day Jordan). The Muslim army, expecting to engage Byzantine-affiliated Arab tribesmen, instead encountered the Byzantine army proper. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the well-trained Roman forces, the Muslim army was on the verge of defeat. One Muslim commander after another was killed. Formations were breaking up. Foot soldiers were beginning to flee. At that point, Khalid assumed command. Grasping the desperation of the situation, he took desperate measures. First, he launched a lightning strike against the Roman flanks, disrupting their charge, and momentarily draining their momentum. Then he ordered his archers, positioned at high ground, to stop the Byzantines from advancing. The strategy was effective as the Romans retreated and camped just outside of the archers’ range for the night. Knowing that he had merely bought some time and that the enemy forces would soon resume their attack, Khalid broke his army into small groups, placed them at different points, and ordered them to arrive at the Muslim camp at different times during the day. This created the illusion that more and more Muslim reinforcements were arriving. This caused the Byzantine army to panic and retreat. \n \n   The 18,000 strong Muslim army met an equally strong Persian army in modern-day Kuwait for the first time where Khalid’s light infantry wore out the heavily armored Persian infantry before launching a decisive attack. This was followed by a quick succession of Muslim victories at Mazar, Walaja, and Ullais which helped the Muslims establish a stronghold in Mesopotamia. Khalid fought his last battle in Mesopotamia at Firaz against 60,000 soldiers of the combined Persian and Roman army. The Persian-Roman army had to cross the Euphrates to get to the Muslim forces and as soon as they did so, Khalid used his light infantry to flank the enemy, capture control of the bridge, and envelop the enemy forces into a pincer movement. The Muslims emerged victorious at Firaz and thus, the conquest of Mesopotamia was complete. \n \n   While legend of Khalid’s military brilliance grew in Mesopotamia, he would not stay there for long as he was ordered by Abu-Bakr, the caliph, to march to Byzantine occupied Syria. According to Islamic historians, Abu Bakr had invaded Syria with four armies with a combined strength of 28,000 men but failed to capture important urban centres because of the large concentration of the Byzantine armies. Khalid took 9,000 men with him to aid the Muslim forces already posted in Syria and on his way defeated the Byzantine forces at Ajnadayn (near modern-day Israel) and Fahl. The remnants of the Byzantine forces retreated to Damascus, where the combined Muslim army laid siege in August 635. Each of the five commanders were put in charge of a gate to the city. As popular narrative dictates, Khalid got news that the Byzantines were celebrating the birth of a nobleman’s son and used this opportunity to breach the Eastern gate and kill the guards. Another Muslim contingent entered through the Western gate after peacefully negotiating a surrender agreement. In September, Damascus surrendered, and the Muslim empire expanded into Syria. Khalid’s greatest victory against the Byzantine empire came at Yarmouk in 636 AD (under the second caliph, Umar). By now Khalid had established himself as the greatest commander in Islamic history and an unrivaled tactician so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the Muslim army under Khalid was able to deflect attacks from a much larger Byzantine host. John Walter Jandora, in his book, Militarism in Arab Society, assesses that the Battle of Yarmouk was one of the most important battles of World History as it led to subsequent Muslim conquests between the Pyrenees and Central Asia. Moreover, Khalid was the first Arabian military leader to meet the Persian and Roman superpowers head-on and be victorious in all conflicts. His conquests served as a blueprint for future conquests by the second caliph, Umar. \n \n   However, in 638, soon after his victory at Yarmouk, Umar relieved Khalid from his position as the supreme commander of the Muslim armies because of his failure to coordinate his actions with the leadership in Madinah. Some sources state that Umar was uneasy with Khalid’s legendary reputation among Muslim armies and feared that they would start looking up to him instead of God for help during battles. Umar’s concerns were not baseless as Khalid was the only one to be given the title of 'Sword of God' by Muhammad himself. It was because of Khalid defying Abu-Bakr’s orders and marching into Iraq that the Persian-Roman stronghold in the East was weakened which resulted in the first expansion of the Islamic state outside of Arabia. Khalid Ibn Al-Walid died in 642 was buried in Homs, Syria, his final resting place commemorating his 50 major victories.""

    ""desc"": ""   Muhammad al Fatih was born on the 27th of Rajab, year 835 H or 30th of March, 1432 AD in the city of Erdine, the capital of Uthmani kingdom at that time. He was the son of Sultan Murad II, the sixth king of the Uthmani kingdom. Sultan Murad II had a great concern for his son’s education. He forged his beloved child to be a great and tough leader later in his life. His concern was proven by how the little Muhammad had finished his memorization of the 30 parts of the Qur’an, learned hadith, comprehended the science of jurisprudence, studied mathematic, astronomy, and war strategy in his young age. Beside that, Muhammad also learned many kind of languages, such as Arabic, Persian, Latin, and Greek. No wonder that at the age of 21, Muhammad was very fluent in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Latin and Greek. \n \n   Even though he was still very young, Muhammad’s father, Sultan Murad II, had trusted him to rule a region with the guidance of some scholars. His father did that to make his son realize faster that he would carry massive responsibility later. Guidance of the scholars were hoped to be a compass to direct his son’s mind, so that it always goes in line with the correct understanding of Islam. The first step Sultan Muhammad took was to realize his ambition to create strategic military and foreign policies. He renewed pact and agreement that was made with neighboring countries and his military allies. Rearrangement of those agreements were aimed to deprive the influence of Roman Byzantium kingdom in the neighboring countries of Uthmani kingdom, both in politic and military fields. \n \n   Sultan Muhammad II also prepared more than 4 million soldiers that will besiege the Constantinople from land. During the besiege of Byzantium fortress, many of the Uthmani soldiers were dead due to the strong defense of that fortress. The besiege took place for no less than 50 days, and it truly tested the patience of the Uthmani soldiers, drained out their power, mind, and logistic. The strong defense of this great Roman empire had been seen from beginning, Before the enemy reached their fortress, Byzantium had built fence on their sea front using metal chains that stretched across the Gold Horn Peninsula. It was impossible to touch the Byzantium fortress except by passing trough those chains. \n \n   Finally, Sultan Mahmud found an idea which he thought was the only way to go through that fence. His idea resembled what the Princes of Kiev, who attacked Byzantium on the 10th century, did. The Princes of Kiev withdrew their ship out of the Bosphorus strait, encircled Galata, and relaunched it on the Golden Horn. Unfortunately, their soldiers were still suffering defeat from the Romans of Byzantium. Sultan Muhammad did the same, but in smarter way. He took his 70 ships with him across Galata to the estuary after they oiled the logs. It was done in a very short time, less than one night. At the morning, the people of Byzantium were dead shocked, since they didn’t think that Sultan Muhammad and his troops could get their ships through land. In their belief,mTo take across 70 ships through land which was still covered with large trees and cut down its trees in one night was impossible, but that exactly what happened. A fierce battle was unavoidable, and the untouchable fortress – the symbol of Byzantium’s power – was finally attacked by soldiers who were fearless of death. Finally, that great, 11 centuries-aged emporium, fell to the hands of the muslims. That great battle resulted in 265.000 casualties from the muslim soldiers. On the 20th of Jumadil Awal, year 857 H, coincided with 29th of May, 1453AD, Sultan al Ghazi Muhammad managed to enter the Constantinople. Since then, he was famous with the name Sultan Muhammad al Fatih, the Conqueror of Constantinople. \n \n   When he entered the Constantinople, Sultan Muhammad al Fatih dismounted from his horse and prostrated as the sign of his gratitude to Allah. After that, he marched to the church Hagia Sophia and ordered his people to change it into mosque. Constantinople was made as a capital, the center of Uthmani government and its name was changed into Islambul, which means 'Islamic country', then it underwent some changes into Istanbul. Beside famous as a skilled general in war, who managed to expand the power of Uthmani kingdom more than other sultans, Muhammad al Fatih was also known as a poet. He created a diwan, a collection of his poetries. Sultan Muhammad also built more than 300 mosques, 57 schools, and 59 bathing places in various regions of Uthmani territory. His most well-known legacy was the mosque of Sultan Muhammad II and Jami’ Abu Ayyub al-Anshari. \n \n   On the month of Rabiul Awwal, year 886 H or 1481 AD, Sultan Muhammad al Fatih went out of Istanbul to fight in Allah’s Cause, while actually he was unwell. In the middle of his journey, his illness worsened. A physician was brought to cure him, but no physician nor drugs could benefit him anymore, and he died amidst his soldiers on Thursday, 4th of Rabiul Awwal, year 886 H or 3rd of May, 1481 AD. At that time, Sultan Muhammad was 52 years old, and had ruled for 31 years. Some said that Sultan Muhammad al Fatih died because he was poisoned by his private doctor, Ya’qub Basya. And Allah knows best. There is no valid evidence that indicate where did Sultan Muhammad II intended to lead his soldiers. Some said that he was heading to Italy to conquer Rome, but some others said that he aimed for France or Spain. Before his death, Muhammad al Fatih willed to his son and successor to his throne, Sultan Bayazid II, to always be close with the scholars, be fair, and not being fooled by wealth, and seriously maintain his religious commitment for himself, his people, and his kingdom. \n \nMay Allah reward you for your merits, O Sultan Muhammad al Fatih…""

fYk4Ji1c,Gambit's Turtle Quarry Program for Computercraft,steellz,Lua,Saturday 12th of August 2023 10:22:59 AM CDT,"--Announcement: In an attempt to add a tunnel boring feature to this, I ended up breaking it so auto refueling no longer works. Version 2.0 is in the works (K6HvcJmD) but many features do not function and I'm taking a break from fixing it, but feel free to edit it if you'd like.

--Note: Computer craft has an issue where turtles will break if left in unloaded chunks, keep near the turtle or use a worldspike.

--This is version 1.2.4, updates will replace the current pastebin with the newer version once they're done!
--Added a boring mode that mines a single layer, good for underground strip mining.

--How to use:
--Place a chest to the left of the turtle for fuel and a chest behind it for a place to drop off items.
--""Quarry or bore?"" Type ""quarry"" for a quarry or ""bore"" to mine a single layer. Make sure you type in all lowercase.
--""Rows"" If looking from above, this is how many blocks it will mine in the 'y' axis.
--""Columns"" If looking from above, this is how many blocks it will mine in the 'x' axis.
--""Current 'y' level?"" The 'y' level of the turtle.
--""Toss garbage blocks?"" Type ""yes"" to toss out stone, gravel, dirt, etc. Make sure you type in all lowercase.

89wzauQH,how to ssh/sftp from windows/linux to Artix VM,ankitpastebin,Bash,Saturday 12th of August 2023 09:29:18 AM CDT,"make sure you have a correctly installed artix vm.
1. stop the machine
2. go to vm settings>network>
3. make sure ""attached to"" is set to NAT(you can also do this with bridged adapter which requires dealing with ip addresses)
4. go to advanced> port forwarding>
5. click on green plus button set host port to 3000 and guest port to 22. change nothing else. click ok.

6. start the VM
7. login into user(and i am assuming you have elevated permissions in user just like root user)
8. >sudo pacman -S openssh-runit
9. >sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/sshd /run/runit/service/
10. >sudo sv start sshd		#(often used to start ssh service if off)
11. go to vscode, install ssh extension(optional), open new terminal and >ssh -p 3000 username@localhost
12. enter yes if prompted for key exchange and type password for artix user and you should be able to sshed(if that's a word) in your VM from vscode in host machine gg

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
there is a way to transfer files from VM to host and host to VM without sshing in machine
after step 10 do the following

in host machine(windows/linux), open terminal/command prompt and enter
>sftp -P 3000 username@localhost

this should connect you to the artix machine's storage.

there are some sftp commands as follows:
get: used to download file from artix VM to windows/linux
put: used to upload file from windows/linux to artix VM.
ls: to list files in artix machine
lls: to list files in host machine
cd <directoryname>: to change directory in artix VM.
lcd: to change directory in local/ host machine.

""l"" before normal command is to indicate that that command is for local machine.

A malicious access point that injects mining scripts on the fly.

Requirements
iptables
python3
Set-up
The tool is a PoC of a rouge access point that injects cryptomining code in the webpages requested by the connected users using HTTP (no HTTPS support). I run a proof of concept on a raspberry Pi, you can search online how to set up an access point. In this code I give as granted that you have set up an access point on a Linux machine (in my case Ubuntu 16.04).

Instructions
First run the bash script:

$ sudo iptables_maliciousAP.sh
Please note that you might have to change the network interface's name accordingly. In this example, wlan0 is the interfaces that is connecting to the internet while wlan1 is the interface where the access point is running and users connect to.

After running the script, request coming in at wlan1, with destination port 80 (HTTP), are forwarded to the localhost on port 9090. Now is time to run the python script:

$ python3 malicious_webserver.py
The latter, receives the requests forwarded by the iptables, retrieves the requested data, injects the cryptomining code (if possible) and returns everything to the client.

Disclaimer
Made for fun and no profit. Only use this tool for education, research, or in the course of approved operations."

; w00p.. this is a standard TSR com infector.  Now before you start
; screaming that I should go code for YAM with **** like this, I would
; like to point out that this virus uses a unique infection method that
; reverses the code.
;
; By pushing everything onto the stack, it reverses the code, that is stored
; backwards, and executes it.  The loader is 16 bytes long and the original
; 16 bytes of the file are stored in the virus code.

- serves a basic page that allows one to type some text in a text area
- once a button is pressed it sends that text through a serial link to the thermal printer and tells it to cut the paper at the end
- also, the setup steps are printed on the integrated OLED display
