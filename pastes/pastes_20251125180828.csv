IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).

Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)
