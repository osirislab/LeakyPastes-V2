IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).

Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)

        ""page_1"": ""<Bold>1. ORIGINS</Bold>\n\nThe creature with the identifier 008 is a refurbished military-grade robot. It was designed and produced by the company Robot Star.\n\nThis robot is equipped with a technological repulsion system that allows it to levitate and thus adapt to any type of terrain, but also serves as a shield against traditional weapons. If this system is deactivated, this robot is equipped with purely mechanical legs that allow it to move.\n\nDuring the mission to recapture the lunar base in 2090, this same repulsion system proved unsuitable for the new laser weapons used by enemy armies. This robot model was therefore quickly withdrawn from the market.\n\nHere are the final words collected from Robot Star’s CEO, John Gramm:\n\n<Italic>“After several years of struggling to restore our finances, and despite the efforts of all employees, I regret to announce the permanent closure of Robot Star. Severance pay will be paid upon the resale of our products and equipment. We were only offered one offer, and although it is insignificant compared to everyone’s efforts and work, we will accept it.”</Italic>\n\nThe stock of robots was purchased by the company Bio Space Group. The goal was to recondition these robots purely for scientific purposes. The machine gun mounted on the robot's mechanical arm was replaced with a 50-centimeter drill bit, capable of drilling into any rock or plant to collect samples.\n\nIn parallel with these scientific missions, this modified robot was deployed in large numbers at certain mining sites to extract large quantities of rare and precious minerals. The company did not bother to modify the shield. Despite its flaws, it was able to limit material damage during confrontations with other creatures."",
        ""page_2"": ""<Bold>2. SPECIMEN DISCOVERY</Bold>\n\nThe number of robots gradually declined, and this model has now been largely replaced. Some of these older models are regularly found, most often in very poor condition. The samples and resources they extracted are, however, still usable in most cases. The wrecks are recovered and then dismantled to collect the resources.\n\nOn March 3, 2121, scientists Elisabeth Weaver and William Miller found one of these older models on the planet NV-1845 on a mining extraction site. Dr. Weaver testified:\n\n<Italic>“The automaton appeared to be in very good condition, although inactive. Its legs were intact but chipped in places. The main trunk was intact, and we had good hopes of recovering usable material.”</Italic>\n\nThey brought it back to their mobile laboratory on the mothership to extract its samples and data. During the operation, Elisabeth Weaver left, leaving Dr. Miller alone with the subject. When she returned, the robot was leaning over her colleague’s body, removing its drill bit from his skull. The robot turned toward her with hostile behavior. Dr. Weaver immediately called the guard stationed at the laboratory entrance.\n\n<Italic>“At the sight of Sergeant McDowell, the robot immediately changed its behavior. It retracted its drill bit and assumed a pacifist attitude.”</Italic>"",
        ""page_3"": ""<Bold>3. THE ESCAPE</Bold>\n\nFollowing this accident, the subject was locked in a glass cell adjacent to Dr. Weaver’s office pending further examination. Surveillance camera footage shows that at 11:26 a.m., the automaton managed to squeeze through the cell’s air vent, allowing it to escape. At 1:51 p.m., Dr. Weaver became aware of its escape and notified the captain. An audio announcement circulated within the ship between 4:00 p.m and 5:00 p.m on March 4, 2121.\n\n<Italic>“Attention everyone. A robotic research subject has escaped from the laboratory and is roaming freely within the ship. This subject is DANGEROUS. This message must be taken very seriously. It appears that this robot only attacks isolated individuals, so it is imperative that you never remain alone. If you encounter it, notify the command office immediately.”</Italic>\n\nUnfortunately, this announcement followed a series of other messages, many of which were false alarms. The ship’s passengers initially did not take this statement seriously.\n\nThanks to the ventilation system, the robot was able to move freely from target to target. Numerous victims were found in the restrooms and showers, and anywhere else passengers sought privacy. The ship’s population decreased by 53% in 24 hours. Following this massacre and the inability to neutralize the robot, the command center decided to head to the nearest port to evacuate the ship."",
        ""page_4"": ""<Bold>4. CONCLUSION</Bold>\n\n<Underline>Suspected behavior of specimen ID_008</Underline>\n\nWe assume that the subject was corrupted during its reconditioning by the Bio Space Group. Its old military program was probably improperly erased, and it may have retained an attack and defense system running in the background of its new scientific program.\n\nIts corrupted program would operate as follows:\n\n• It recognizes humans when they are in groups, and only in groups. It then adopts a pacifist attitude, while following this group.\n\n• The subject mistakes isolated humans for its research subjects (minerals or plants). It thus seeks to grab its target with its claw, drive a drill into it, and collect samples.\n\n• If its shield is deactivated, it loses its levitation abilities (anti-gravity repulsion). It then switches to its old military program and attacks any potential threats, whether or not they are in a group. At this point it is able to generate EMP discharges to disable any nearby systems.\n\nTo date, we do not know if other robots of this type exhibit this defect or if this case is unique. It could have been the first prototype for reconditioning, which would explain why its flaws were not previously identified.""

        ""page_1"": ""<Bold>1. ORIGINS</Bold>\n\nThe creature with the identifier 008 is a refurbished military-grade robot. It was designed and produced by the company Robot Star.\n\nThis robot is equipped with a technological repulsion system that allows it to levitate and thus adapt to any type of terrain, but also serves as a shield against traditional weapons. If this system is deactivated, this robot is equipped with purely mechanical legs that allow it to move.\n\nDuring the mission to recapture the lunar base in 2090, this same repulsion system proved unsuitable for the new laser weapons used by enemy armies. This robot model was therefore quickly withdrawn from the market.\n\nHere are the final words collected from Robot Star’s CEO, John Gramm:\n\n<Italic>“After several years of struggling to restore our finances, and despite the efforts of all employees, I regret to announce the permanent closure of Robot Star. Severance pay will be paid upon the resale of our products and equipment. We were only offered one offer, and although it is insignificant compared to everyone’s efforts and work, we will accept it.”</Italic>\n\nThe stock of robots was purchased by the company Bio Space Group. The goal was to recondition these robots purely for scientific purposes. The machine gun mounted on the robot's mechanical arm was replaced with a 50-centimeter drill bit, capable of drilling into any rock or plant to collect samples.\n\nIn parallel with these scientific missions, this modified robot was deployed in large numbers at certain mining sites to extract large quantities of rare and precious minerals. The company did not bother to modify the shield. Despite its flaws, it was able to limit material damage during confrontations with other creatures."",
        ""page_2"": ""<Bold>2. SPECIMEN DISCOVERY</Bold>\n\nThe number of robots gradually declined, and this model has now been largely replaced. Some of these older models are regularly found, most often in very poor condition. The samples and resources they extracted are, however, still usable in most cases. The wrecks are recovered and then dismantled to collect the resources.\n\nOn March 3, 2121, scientists Elisabeth Weaver and William Miller found one of these older models on the planet NV-1845 on a mining extraction site. Dr. Weaver testified:\n\n<Italic>“The automaton appeared to be in very good condition, although inactive. Its legs were intact but chipped in places. The main trunk was intact, and we had good hopes of recovering usable material.”</Italic>\n\nThey brought it back to their mobile laboratory on the mothership to extract its samples and data. During the operation, Elisabeth Weaver left, leaving Dr. Miller alone with the subject. When she returned, the robot was leaning over her colleague’s body, removing its drill bit from his skull. The robot turned toward her with hostile behavior. Dr. Weaver immediately called the guard stationed at the laboratory entrance.\n\n<Italic>“At the sight of Sergeant McDowell, the robot immediately changed its behavior. It retracted its drill bit and assumed a pacifist attitude.”</Italic>"",
        ""page_3"": ""<Bold>3. THE ESCAPE</Bold>\n\nFollowing this accident, the subject was locked in a glass cell adjacent to Dr. Weaver’s office pending further examination. Surveillance camera footage shows that at 11:26 a.m., the automaton managed to squeeze through the cell’s air vent, allowing it to escape. At 1:51 p.m., Dr. Weaver became aware of its escape and notified the captain. An audio announcement circulated within the ship between 4:00 p.m and 5:00 p.m on March 4, 2121.\n\n<Italic>“Attention everyone. A robotic research subject has escaped from the laboratory and is roaming freely within the ship. This subject is DANGEROUS. This message must be taken very seriously. It appears that this robot only attacks isolated individuals, so it is imperative that you never remain alone. If you encounter it, notify the command office immediately.”</Italic>\n\nUnfortunately, this announcement followed a series of other messages, many of which were false alarms. The ship’s passengers initially did not take this statement seriously.\n\nThanks to the ventilation system, the robot was able to move freely from target to target. Numerous victims were found in the restrooms and showers, and anywhere else passengers sought privacy. The ship’s population decreased by 53% in 24 hours. Following this massacre and the inability to neutralize the robot, the command center decided to head to the nearest port to evacuate the ship."",
        ""page_4"": ""<Bold>4. CONCLUSION</Bold>\n\n<Underline>Suspected behavior of specimen ID_008</Underline>\n\nWe assume that the subject was corrupted during its reconditioning by the Bio Space Group. Its old military program was probably improperly erased, and it may have retained an attack and defense system running in the background of its new scientific program.\n\nIts corrupted program would operate as follows:\n\n• It recognizes humans when they are in groups, and only in groups. It then adopts a pacifist attitude, while following this group.\n\n• The subject mistakes isolated humans for its research subjects (minerals or plants). It thus seeks to grab its target with its claw, drive a drill into it, and collect samples.\n\n• If its shield is deactivated, it loses its levitation abilities (anti-gravity repulsion). It then switches to its old military program and attacks any potential threats, whether or not they are in a group. At this point it is able to generate EMP discharges to disable any nearby systems.\n\nTo date, we do not know if other robots of this type exhibit this defect or if this case is unique. It could have been the first prototype for reconditioning, which would explain why its flaws were not previously identified.""

IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).
 
Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)
