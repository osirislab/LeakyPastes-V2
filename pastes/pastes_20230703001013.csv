[ADDED]Hide mode (hides you from anticheat and moderators so there is no way to get banned)
[ADDED]x2 Faster farm (Makes the farming way faster)
[ADDED]Load Time (the script will load a bit slower to make sure the hide mode are fully activated and the farm will be faster)
[ADDED BY ITSELF]Sometimes the script crashes after a few hours and some of ur pets will get duper or the power will get set to 999q(the scrpt sets the power of the pets to this for 0.1 sec so they can farm gems). wont try to fix it cus it gives you op pets sometimes.

iwiPn9S2,VLAD Magazine - Issue #7 - ARTICLE.4_1 - Zip Virus,FlyFar,ASM (NASM),Sunday 2nd of July 2023 09:55:59 AM CDT,";Lately I've seen some viruses boasting they could infect archivers.
;(Hi Sepultura, didnt you test chaos-ad ???)
;This is quite simple for ARJ etc. But with PKZIP this is quite different,
;due to the way PKZIP gets the size of the files to be compressed.
;Most archivers look for files via INT 21h/ah=4Eh/4Fh.
;Then the file is opened and compressed, no matter whats in the DTA.
;PKZIP looks up filesizes before opening files and stores them somehow.
;Only the filesize in the DTA will be compressed. That means, if a FastInfector
;, infecting on OpenFile, is active, it will NOT be in the compressed file !
;(Well, yes, the header changes are compressed, but the main portion appended
;to the host will be lost).
;
;So the Idea is the following :
;-look for files with extension .ZIP being opened for Read/Write access
; (PKUNZIP opens for readonly)
;-if a ZIP-file is opened, set a flag for enabling infect on OpenFile
;-if a ZIP-File is closed, it is assumed compression is over -> clear flag
;-whenever FindFirst/FindNext occurs and flag is set,
; check if file is infectable; if so,
; increase FileSize in DTA (may do some DirStealth if not)
;-whenever a file is opened, check flag
;-if flag is set, infect file the usual way
;-disinfect when its closed (oly the archived files shall be infected)
;
;Care should be taken not to infect files whose size wasnt increased
;(CRC-Errors, corruption of program), or to increase Filesizes of files
;one will not infect later
;(resulting in CRC-Errors)
;
;
;The following code does it, but it is in NO way optimized.
;Some parts are plain bogus, as the whole stuff is experimental.
;It will infect suitable COMs that are compressed with PKZIP to an
;archive with the extension .ZIP, nothing else.
;
;Routines commented in Italian are with friendly permission of Tankard.
;
;And, ehhmmm, there is a problem with INT 21h/ah=4Eh. Some programs hang
;with this routine active, so i commented it out. (Solutions?)
