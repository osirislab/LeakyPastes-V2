The officers drew their sidearms, aimed, and fired. A tranquilizer pellet stuck to Artemis's neck, dissolving instantly. The officers hit Butler with four, not taking any chances.
Artemis could hear Holly protesting as his vision blurred like an Impressionist painting. Like The Fairy Thief.
'There's no need for that, Sool,“ she said, catching Artemis's elbow. ”They've seen the chute already. You could have returned them conscious.“
Sool's voice sounded as though he were speaking from the bottom of a well. “I'm not taking any chances, Captain, I mean, Miss Short. Humans are violent creatures by nature, especially when they are being transported.”
Artemis felt Holly's hand on his chest. Under his jacket, she slipped something into his pocket.
But he couldn't ask what, because his tongue would not obey him. All he could do with his mouth was breathe.
He heard a thump behind him.
Butler 's gone, he concluded. Just me left.
And then he was gone too.

'Can do,“ said Butler, crawling to the port side exit. He knuckled the access button and the door slid back. The shuttle bucked slightly as the cabin pressure equalized then settled.
Butler opened his bag of weaponry and selected a handful of metal spheres, roughly the size of tennis balls. He flicked back the safety cap on one, then depressed the button below with his thumb. The button began to rise to its original position.
'Ten seconds until the button is flush with the surface. Then it makes a connection.“
'Thank you for the lecture,“ said Artemis dryly. ”Though now is hardly the time.“
Butler smiled, tossing the metal sphere into the air. Five seconds later it exploded, blowing a small crater in the earth below. Scorch lines emanated from the crater, giving it the appearance of a black flower.

h7bd6nKy?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 02:04:30 PM CDT,"Artemis selected his own file by touching the plasma screen's transparent covering. The file glowed orange, then expanded to fill this e screen. Artemis saw himself in Fowl Manor, sitting at his desk in the study.
'Greetings,“ said the screen Artemis. ”How nice for you to see me. Doubtless, this will be the first intelligent conversation you have had for some time.“
The real Artemis smiled. “Correct,” he replied.
'I paused for a second there,“ continued the screen Artemis. ”To give you a chance to respond, thus qualifying this as a conversation. There will be no more pausing, as time is limited. Captain Holly Short is downstairs being distracted by Juliet, but doubtless she will check on me soon.
We depart for Chicago presently to deal with Mr. Jon Spiro, who has stolen something from me. The price of fairy assistance in this matter is a mind wipe. All memories of the People will be erased forever, unless I leave a message for my future self, 
thus prompting recall. This is that message. The following video footage contains specific details of my involvement with the Fairy People. I hope this information will get those brain cell pathways sparking again.“
Artemis rubbed his forehead. The vague mysterious flashes persisted. It seemed as though his brain was ready to rebuild those pathways. All he needed was the right stimulus.
'In conclusion,“ said the screen Artemis. ”I would like to wish you, myself, the best of luck. And welcome back.“
The next hour passed in a blur. Images flashed from the screen, adhering to empty spaces in Artemis's brain. Each memory felt right the instant Artemis processed it.
Of course, he thought. This explains everything. I had the mirrored contact lenses made so I could lie to the fairies and hide the existence of this journal. I fixed Mulch Diggums's search warrant so that he could return the disk to me. Butler looks older because he is older; the fairy healing in London saved his life, but cost him fifteen years.
The memories were not all proud ones. I kidnapped Captain Short. I imprisoned Holly. How could I have done that?
He could not deny it any longer. This was all true. Everything that his eyes had seen was real. The fairies existed and his life had been intertwined with theirs for more than two years. A million images sprouted in his consciousness, rebuilding electric bridges in his brain. They strobed behind his eyes in a confusing display of color and wonder. A lesser mind than Artemis's could have been 
utterly exhausted, but the Irish boy was exhilarated.
I know it all now, he thought. I beat Koboi before, and I will do it again. This determination was fuelled by sadness. Commander Root is gone. Koboi took him from his People.
Artemis had known this earlier, but now it meant something.
There was one other thought, more persistent than the rest.
It crashed into his mind like a tsunami.
I have friends? thought Artemis Fowl the Second.
I have friends.

Holly did. The light winked green, and the cuffs popped open.
'Good. Excellent. Now let me do yours.“
Artemis's fingers paused over the keyboard.
'I don't read the fairy language or numerals.“
'You do. In fact, you are the only human who does,“ said Holly. ”You just don't remember.
The pad is standard layout. Zero to nine. Left to right.“
'Nine zero nine,“ muttered Artemis, pressing the appropriate keys. Holly's cuffs popped on the first try, which was fortunate because there would be no time for a second.

There was even a stereo system wired to each room that would pump talk radio into various areas of the house. All measures designed to put off the casual burglar. None of which, Butler knew, would put off a professional thief.

4QVSgueJ?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 01:17:06 PM CDT,"Artemis Fowl woke from a sleep haunted by nightmares. In his dreams, strange, red-eyed creatures had ripped open his chest with scimitar tusks and dined on his heart. He sat up in an undersized cot, both hands flying to his chest. His shirt was caked with dried blood, but there was no wound.
Artemis took several deep shuddering breaths, pumping oxygen through his brain.
Assess the situation, Butler always told him.
If you find yourself in unfamiliar territory, become familiar with it before opening your mouth. Ten seconds of observation could save your life.
Artemis looked around, eyelids fluttering like camera shutters, absorbing every detail. He was in a small box room, about ten square feet. One wall was completely transparent and appeared to look out over the Dublin quays. From the position of the Millennium Bridge, the room was somewhere in the Temple Bar area. The chamber itself was constructed from a strange material. Some kind of silver-gray fabric. Rigid, but malleable, with several plasma screens on the opaque walls. It was all extremely hi-tech, but seemed years old, and almost abandoned.
In the corner, a girl sat hunched on folding chair. She cradled her head in both hands, her shoulders hitching gently with sobs.
Artemis cleared his throat. “Why are you crying, girl?”

The Opal Deception, Chapter 5"
gz1y2ncc?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 01:06:53 PM CDT,"'Is there a problem?“ asked Artemis.
Butler did not reply because he didn't have time.
Instead he grabbed the teenager by the scruff of the neck and hoisted him onto his own back.
'The painting!“ Artemis managed to shout, his voice muffled by the bodyguard's jacket.
Butler grabbed the picture, unceremoniously stuffing the priceless masterpiece into his jacket pocket. If Artemis had been able to see the century-old oil paint crack, he would have sobbed.
But Butler was only paid to protect one thing, and it was not The Fairy Thief.
'Hang on extremely tightly,“ advised the massive bodyguard, hefting a king-size mattress from the bed.
Artemis held on tight as he'd been told, trying not to think. Unfortunately his brilliant brain automatically analysed the available data: Butler had entered the room at speed and without knocking; therefore, there was danger some kind. His refusal to answer questions meant that the danger was imminent. And the fact that Artemis was on Butler 's back, hanging on tightly, indicated that they would not be escaping the aforementioned danger through conventional exit routes. The mattress would indicate that some cushioning would be needed.
'Butler,“ gasped Artemis. ”You do know that we're three stories up?“
Butler might have answered, but his employer did not hear him, because by then the giant bodyguard had propelled them through the open double windows and over the balcony railing.
For a fraction of a second, before the inevitable fall, the air currents spun the mattress around, and Artemis could see back into his own bedroom.
In that splinter of a moment, he saw a strange missile corkscrew through the bedroom door and come to a complete halt directly over the empty Perspex tube. There was some kind of tracker in the tube, said the tiny portion of his brain that wasn't panicking. Someone wants me dead.
Then came the inevitable fall. Thirty feet.
Straight down.
Butler automatically spread his limbs in a skydiving X, bearing down on the four corners of the mattress to stop it from flipping. The trapped air below the mattress slowed their fall slightly, but not much. The pair went straight down, fast, G-force increasing their speed with every inch.
Sky and ground seemed to stretch and drip like oil paints on a canvas, and nothing seemed solid anymore. This impression came to an abrupt halt when they slammed into the extremely solid tiled roof of a maintenance shed at the hotel's rear.
The tiles seemed to almost explode under the impact, though the roof timbers held-barely. Butler felt as though his bones had been liquidized, but he knew that he would be okay after a few moments of unconsciousness. He had been in worse collisions before.
His last impression before his senses deserted him was the feel of Master Artemis's heartbeat through his jacket. Alive, then. They had both survived.
But for how long? If their assassin had seen his attempt fail, then maybe he would try again.
Artemis's impact was cushioned by Butler and the mattress. Without them he certainly would have been killed. As it was, the bodyguard's muscle-bound frame was dense enough to break two of his ribs. Artemis bounced a full three feet into the air before coming to rest on the unconscious bodyguard's back, facing the sky.
Each breath was short and painful, and two nubs of bone rose like knuckles from his chest. Sixth and seventh rib, he guessed.

The Opal Deception, Chapter 4"
e1MfCWMw?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 12:57:37 PM CDT,"Artemis wasn't the only one with a case of instruments. Butler opened a chrome briefcase on the coffee table. It was one of a dozen such cases that he held in safe-deposit boxes in the world's capitals. Each case was full to bursting with surveillance equipment, counter surveillance equipment, and weaponry. Having one in each country meant that he did not have to break customs laws on each overseas trip from Ireland.
He selected a bug sweeper and quickly ran it around the room, searching for listening devices. He concentrated on the electrical appliances: phone, television, fax machine. The electronic waffle from those items could often drown a bug's signal, but not with this particular sweeper. The Eye Spy was the most advanced sweeper on the market and could detect a pinhole mike half a 
mile away.
After several minutes he was satisfied, and was on the point of returning the device to the case, when it registered a tiny electrical field. Nothing much, barely a single flickering blue bar on the indicator. The first bar solidified, then turned bright blue. The second bar began to flicker. Something electronic was closing in on them. most men would have discounted the reading. After all, there were several thousand electronic devices within a square mile of the Kronski Hotel. But normal electronic fields did not register on the Eye Spy, and Butler was not most men. He extended the sweeper's aerial, and panned the device around the room. The reading spiked when the aerial was pointed at the window. A claw of anxiety tugged at Butler 's intestines. Something airborne was coming closer at high speed.
He dashed to the window, ripped the net curtains from their hooks, and flung open the window. The winter air was pale blue with remarkably few clouds.
Jet trails crisscrossed the sky like a giant's game of tic-tac-toe. And there, twenty degrees up-a gentle spiraling curve- was a tear-shaped rocket of blue metal. A red light winked on its nose, and white-hot flames billowed from its rear end. The rocket was heading for the Kronski, no doubt about it.
It's a smart bomb, Butler said to himself without one iota of doubt.
And Master Artemis is the target.

xYw8dJgS?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 12:50:36 PM CDT,"Artemis opened an audio manipulation program on his Powerbook and set about cutting and pasting his mother's words from the recorded phone call. When he had selected the words he wanted, and put them in the right order, he smoothed the levels 
to make the speech sound natural.
When Principal Guiney turned on his mobile phone after the visit to Munich 's Olympia Stadium, there would be a new message waiting for him. It would be from Angeline Fowl, and she would not be in a good mood.
Artemis routed the call through Fowl Manor, then sent the edited sound file by infrared to his own mobile phone.
'Principal Guiney.“ The voice was unmistakably Angeline Fowl's, and the caller ID would confirm it. ”I'm worried about Arty. He has a dose of food poisoning. His outlook is marvelous and he never complains, but we want him home with us. You understand. I put Arty on a plane home. I am surprised he got a dose of food poisoning under your care. We will talk more on your return.“
That took care of school for a few days. The dark half of Artemis felt an electric thrill at the subterfuge, but his growing conscience felt a tug of guilt at using his mother's voice to weave his web of lies.
He banished the guilt. It was a harmless lie.

NhuqgKBq?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 11:14:33 AM CDT,"Artemis studied the locker with the X-ray panel before opening the door any wider. He was searching for any wires or circuits that might trigger secondary alarms. There was one. A circuit breaker attached to a portable Klaxon. It would be extremely embarrassing for any thief if the authorities were alerted by the raucous wailing of a foghorn. Artemis smiled. It seemed as though Crane and Sparrow had a sense of humor.
Maybe he would employ them as his lawyers.
Artemis unhooked the headphones from around his neck, popping off the earpieces. Once the wire inside was exposed, he twisted a length around each side of the breaker. Now he could safely pull apart the breaker without opening the circuit. Artemis pulled. The Klaxon remained silent.

QpFdgpfK?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 11:12:09 AM CDT,"There were eight feet between the deposit box and the master keyhole by the door. Not only was it impossible for one person to open the door unassisted, but whoever stood by the master keyhole would be visible to the security guards. Artemis pulled his scooter from the backpack. He yanked one pin from its socket, detaching the steering column from the footrest. This was no ordinary scooter. An engineer friend of Butler 's had constructed it from very specific blueprints. The footrest was completely regular, but the steering column turned into a telescope at the touch of a spring-release button. Artemis unscrewed on e handgrip, reattaching it at the other end of the column. There was a slit in the end of each grip, into which Artemis screwed a master key. Now all he had to do was insert both keys into their corresponding keyholes and turn them simultaneously.
Artemis slotted one key into Crane and Sparrow's box.
'Ready?“ he asked Butler.
'Yes,“ replied his bodyguard. ”Don't go one step farther than you have to.“
'Three, two, one. Go.“
Artemis pressed the spring-release button on the steering column. He shuffled across the bench, pulling the telescoping pole behind him. As the boy moved, Butler swiveled his trunk so that Artemis remained shielded by the blueprint. He moved the plan just far enough to cover the master keyhole, without exposing Artemis's legless shoes. However, the target box, complete with telescoping pole, was visible for the time it took Artemis to insert the second key.
The master keyhole was three feet beyond the end of the steel bench. Artemis leaned as far as he could without losing his balance, slotting the key into its hole. It fit snugly. Artemis shuffled back quickly. Now Butler could once again mask Crane and Sparrow's box. The entire plan hinged on the assumption that the guards would be concentrating on Butler, and not notice a slim pole extending 
toward the master keyhole. It would help that the pole was precisely the same color as the safe-deposit boxes.
Artemis returned to the original box, twisting the handgrip. A pulley and cable system inside the pole twisted the other handgrip simultaneously.
Both locks flashed green. Crane and Sparrow's box popped open. Artemis felt a moment of satisfaction. His contraption had worked. Then again, there was no reason it shouldn't: all the laws of physics had been obeyed. Amazing how the tightest of electronic security could be defeated by a pole, a pulley, and a brace.

uSkVMFxz?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 11:07:28 AM CDT,"'Blokken,“ said the boy triumphantly. ”We were right.“
There were only six firms in the world capable of constructing deposit boxes of this quality.
Artemis had hacked their computers and found International Bank on the Blokken client list.
Blokken was a small family company in Vienna that also made boxes for several banks in Geneva and the Cayman Islands. Butler had paid their workshop a little visit and stolen two master keys. Of course, the keys were metal, and would not escape the detector arch, unless for some reason metal had been allowed through.
Artemis reached two fingers into his mouth, dislodging the brace from his upper teeth. Behind the brace itself was a plastic retainer, and clipped to that were two keys. The master keys.
Artemis rotated his jaw for a few seconds.
'That feels better,“ he said. ”I thought I was going to gag.“

P5EAd087?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 11:05:20 AM CDT,"Artemis rooted through his backpack for the video cube. Though the box did actually play a computer game, its primary function was an X-ray panel with real-time viewing. The X-ray panels were in common usage among the upper criminal echelons, and it had been a relatively simple matter for Artemis to disguise one as a teenager's toy.
Artemis activated the X-ray, sliding it across the door of the deposit box beside Butler's.
The bodyguard had rented his box two days after Crane and Sparrow. It stood to reason that the boxes would be close to one another, unless Crane and Sparrow had requested a specific number. In that case it was back to the drawing board. Artemis reckoned that this first attempt to steal The Fairy Thief had a forty percent chance of success. These were not ideal odds, but he had no option but to 
go ahead. At the very least, he would learn more about the bank's security.
The game cube's small screen revealed that the first box was stuffed with currency.
'Negative,“ said Artemis. ”Cash only.“
Butler raised an eyebrow. “You know what they say; you can never have too much cash.”
Artemis had already moved on to the next box.
'Not today, old friend. But let's keep up the rental on our box, in case we ever need to return.“

WaHcUhk8?source=archive,Untitled,dgl_2,text,Monday 16th of February 2026 08:21:13 AM CDT,"Butler glared at him. “Alfonse! Can't you do what the man says? In the army I would have you cleaning the latrines for this kind of behavior.”
Artemis glared back. “Yes, Colonel, but we're not in the army here, are we?”
Kurt slipped Artemis's pack from his back and rifled through the contents.
""What's this?"" he asked, pulling out a toughened plastic frame.
Artemis took the frame, unfolding it with three deft movements. “It's a scooter, dude. You may have heard of them. Transportation that doesn't pollute the air we breathe.”
Kurt snatched back the scooter, spinning the wheels and checking the joints.
Artemis smirked. “Of course, it's also a laser cutter, so I can break into your boxes.”
""You're a real smart aleck, boy,"" snarled Kurt, stuffing the scooter back in the bag. ”And what's this?“
Artemis turned on the video game. “It's a game box. They were invented so teenagers wouldn't have to talk to grownups.”
Kurt glanced at Butler. “He's a gem, sir. I wish I had one just like him.” He rattled a ring of keys on Artemis's belt. “And what are these?”
Artemis scratched his head. “Uh… keys?”
Kurt ground his teeth audibly. “I know they're keys, boy. What do they open?”
Artemis shrugged. “Stuff. My locker. My scooter lock. A couple of diaries. Stuff.”
The security guard examined the keys. They were everyday keys, and wouldn't open a complicated lock.
But the bank had a no-key rule. Only safe-deposit box keys were allowed through the metal detector.
'Sorry. The keys stay here.“ Kurt undipped the ring and placed the keys in a flat tray. ”You can pick them up on your way out.“
'Can I go now?“
'Yes,“ said Kurt. ”Please do, but pass the bag through to your father first.“
Artemis handed the bag around the metal detector arch to Butler. He passed through himself, setting off the buzzer.
Kurt followed him impatiently. “Do you have anything else metallic on you? A belt buckle? Some coins?”
'Money?“ scoffed Artemis. ”I wish.“
'What's setting off the detector, then?“ said Kurt, puzzled.
'I think I know,“ said Artemis. He hooked a finger inside his top lip, pulling it up. Two metal bands ran across his teeth.
'Braces. That would do it,“ said Kurt. ”The detector is extremely sensitive.“
Artemis removed his finger from his mouth. “Should I take these out too? Rip them from my teeth?”
Kurt took the suggestion at face value.
'No. I think we're safe enough. Just go on through.
But behave yourself in there. It's a vault, not a playground.“ Kurt paused, pointing to a camera above their heads. ”Remember, I'll be watching.“
'Watch all you like,“ said Artemis brazenly.

""Lo studio Invalsi: nei quartieri più problematici un diplomato su 4 non comprende un testo."" Ma come è possibile che un diplomato non comprenda un testo?

di Google Gemini



 È una domanda legittima e, onestamente, piuttosto amara. Com’è possibile che dopo 13 anni di scuola si arrivi alla maturità senza padroneggiare quella che è la competenza base della cittadinanza?

Il fenomeno che descrivi viene definito dagli esperti ""dispersione scolastica implicita"". A differenza della dispersione esplicita (chi abbandona la scuola), questi ragazzi il diploma lo prendono, ma ""sulla carta"": le loro competenze reali sono paragonabili a quelle di chi ha appena terminato la terza media.

Ecco i principali fattori che spiegano come si arriva a questo paradosso:

1. La ""Povertà Educativa"" e il contesto sociale
Nei quartieri problematici, la scuola spesso opera in un vuoto. Se a casa non ci sono libri, se il linguaggio familiare è limitato o se mancano stimoli culturali esterni, la scuola fatica a colmare il divario. Non è solo un problema di studio, ma di esposizione al linguaggio: chi legge meno e parla meno, fatica a decodificare strutture sintattiche complesse.

2. Promozioni ""per trascinamento""
Esiste una pressione sociale e burocratica che spinge a non bocciare, specialmente nei contesti difficili. Il ragionamento spesso è: ""Se lo bocciamo, lo perdiamo e finisce in strada"". Così, molti studenti vengono promossi con lacune gravi che si accumulano anno dopo anno, rendendo il recupero quasi impossibile alle superiori.

3. La differenza tra ""leggere"" e ""comprendere""
Molti di questi diplomati sanno leggere a livello meccanico (alfabetizzazione primaria), ma falliscono nella comprensione profonda:

Non sanno distinguere i fatti dalle opinioni.

Non riescono a fare inferenze (capire ciò che non è scritto esplicitamente ma è sottointeso).

Hanno un vocabolario troppo limitato per comprendere termini astratti o tecnici.

4. L'impatto del digitale
L'abitudine a testi brevi, frammentati e immediati (social media) ha ridotto la ""resistenza alla lettura"". Un testo lungo richiede attenzione sostenuta e memoria di lavoro, muscoli che in molti ragazzi risultano ormai atrofizzati.

In sintesi: Il diploma, in questi casi, smette di essere una certificazione di competenze e diventa un ""certificato di frequenza"". Il sistema valuta la presenza e il comportamento, ma non riesce a garantire che il contenuto sia stato davvero assimilato.

È un fallimento che non riguarda solo lo studente, ma l'intero ascensore sociale del Paese.



Le soluzioni proposte da esperti, pedagogisti e dallo stesso istituto INVALSI non si limitano a ""chiedere di studiare di più"", ma puntano a una riforma strutturale del modo in cui la scuola vive nel territorio.

Per contrastare la dispersione implicita e il deficit di comprensione, le strategie principali si muovono su tre assi:

1. Il ""Tempo Pieno"" e le Scuole Aperte
Una delle soluzioni più caldeggiate è l'estensione dell'orario scolastico nei quartieri a rischio.

Scuola come hub: Trasformare l'edificio scolastico in un centro culturale aperto anche al pomeriggio e alla sera per attività extra-curcolari (musica, sport, teatro).

Mensa obbligatoria: Garantire il tempo pieno significa sottrarre i ragazzi a contesti di strada o di isolamento domestico per più ore al giorno.

2. Differenziazione della Didattica
Poiché le classi sono eterogenee, la lezione frontale ""uguale per tutti"" spesso fallisce.

Apprendimento laboratoriale: Invece di ascoltare passivamente una lezione, gli studenti lavorano su progetti concreti che richiedono l'uso della lettura e della logica per essere risolti.

Mentoring e Tutoring: Affiancare agli studenti più fragili dei tutor (anche studenti universitari o peer-to-peer) per colmare le lacune specifiche in modo personalizzato.

3. I ""Patti Educativi di Comunità""
La scuola non può farcela da sola. Questa soluzione prevede un'alleanza formale tra:

Istituzioni scolastiche.

Terzo settore (associazioni, parrocchie, volontariato).

Famiglie e imprese locali.
L'obiettivo è creare un ecosistema dove l'educazione continui anche fuori dalla classe, rendendo la cultura ""di prossimità"".

4. Monitoraggio Precoce (Early Warning)
Invece di accorgersi del problema alla maturità, si propone di utilizzare i dati INVALSI già dalle elementari e medie per intervenire subito.

Se un bambino in seconda elementare mostra difficoltà nella comprensione del testo, devono scattare immediatamente protocolli di recupero mirati, prima che il divario diventi incolmabile.

Le risorse: Il PNRR
Attualmente, l'Italia sta investendo una parte consistente dei fondi del PNRR (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza) proprio per la riduzione dei divari territoriali. Questi fondi sono destinati a:

Potenziamento delle competenze di base (Italiano, Matematica, Inglese).

Lotta alla dispersione scolastica attraverso percorsi di counseling e orientamento.

Formazione dei docenti su tecniche didattiche innovative per contesti difficili.

Il punto critico: La sfida non è solo economica, ma culturale. Bisogna ridare valore al merito e alla competenza, assicurandosi che il diploma torni a essere un traguardo reale e non un semplice ""pezzo di carta"" concesso per non creare conflitti sociali.



Guardare fuori dai nostri confini aiuta a capire che la ""dispersione implicita"" non è un destino inevitabile. Diversi Paesi europei hanno affrontato crisi simili ottenendo risultati straordinari grazie a riforme coraggiose.

Ecco tre modelli di successo da cui l'Italia sta prendendo spunto:

1. Estonia: La ""Tigre"" dell'Educazione
L'Estonia è oggi il numero uno in Europa nei test PISA (l'equivalente internazionale dell'Invalsi). Come ci è riuscita?

Equità radicale: Tutte le scuole, sia in città che nei villaggi rurali poveri, ricevono lo stesso livello di risorse. Non esistono ""scuole di serie B"".

Autonomia e fiducia: Gli insegnanti hanno una libertà quasi totale su come insegnare, ma sono monitorati costantemente sui risultati reali degli studenti.

Digitalizzazione precoce: Non solo computer in classe, ma l'uso del digitale per personalizzare l'apprendimento: se un ragazzo fatica a comprendere un testo, il software adatta gli esercizi al suo livello finché non migliora.

2. Portogallo: Il ""Miracolo"" della resilienza
Il Portogallo, fino a vent'anni fa, aveva dati sulla dispersione scolastica peggiori dell'Italia. Oggi ci ha superati.

Investimento sull'infanzia: Hanno reso la scuola dell'infanzia quasi universale (dai 3 anni), capendo che le lacune di comprensione si creano prima dei 6 anni.

Programma TEIP: È un piano specifico per le aree ""problematiche"" (Territórios Educativos de Intervenção Prioritária). Le scuole in quartieri difficili ricevono più fondi, più psicologi e più assistenti sociali per supportare le famiglie, non solo gli studenti.

Niente ""promozioni facili"": Hanno puntato su sistemi di supporto intensivo immediato non appena uno studente mostra le prime difficoltà, evitando di trascinare le lacune fino al diploma.

3. Finlandia: La professione docente al centro
La Finlandia è famosa per avere il minor divario al mondo tra lo studente migliore e quello peggiore.

Insegnanti super-selezionati: Per insegnare serve un Master (laurea magistrale) e solo il 10% dei candidati supera i test d'ingresso. Questo garantisce che anche nei quartieri più difficili ci siano i professionisti migliori.

Supporto speciale di serie: Circa il 30% degli studenti finlandesi riceve, in un momento o nell'altro della carriera scolastica, una qualche forma di ""supporto speciale"" o lezione privata gratuita offerta dalla scuola per non restare indietro.

Meno test, più comprensione: Si fanno pochissimi esami standardizzati, lasciando tempo alla lettura critica e al dibattito in classe.

Cosa possiamo imparare?
Dall'analisi di questi casi emerge un filo conduttore: i soldi da soli non bastano. Serve:

Iniziare a intervenire a 3-4 anni, non a 14.

Portare i migliori professori nei quartieri più difficili (magari con incentivi economici).

Considerare la scuola come un centro sociale aperto 10 ore al giorno, non 5.

Curiosità: In Estonia, il pranzo scolastico è gratuito per tutti gli studenti. Sembra un dettaglio, ma garantisce che ogni bambino sia nelle condizioni fisiche ottimali per concentrarsi e imparare.

Lo studio Invalsi: nei grandi centri la dispersione è tre volte il dato regionale Nei quartieri più problematici un diplomato su 4 non comprende un testo.

PODCAST - Diplomi vuoti nelle ricche città del Nord
https://is.gd/GEdL7M

di FRANCESCA DEL VECCHIO



Nel Nord che produce oltre la metà del Pil nazionale, quasi un giovane su dieci esce dal sistema di istruzione senza un diploma. E tra quelli che il diploma lo ottengono, una quota non trascurabile non raggiunge le competenze minime in italiano, matematica e inglese. È dentro questa doppia misura - dispersione esplicita e implicita - che si gioca una parte decisiva della tenuta educativa ed economica del Paese. Partiamo dalla dispersione esplicita. Secondo alcuni rapporti, nel 2024 il 9,8% dei giovani tra i 18 e i 24 anni aveva al massimo la licenza media e non era inserito in percorsi di istruzione o formazione. 

Non si tratta di studenti ancora in aula, ma di giovani che hanno già interrotto il loro percorso senza conseguire un titolo. L’Italia resta sopra la media Ue (8,4%) ed è ancora distante dai Paesi che hanno portato il tasso sotto il 5%. Le differenze territoriali sono nette. Nel Mezzogiorno i valori restano più elevati: Sicilia 15,2%, Campania 13,3%, Calabria 10,8%. Le regioni del Nord si collocano su livelli più bassi e più vicini all’obiettivo europeo del 9% fissato per il 2030. Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia e Lombardia si attestano in genere tra il 6 e l’8%. Il Piemonte è intorno all’8,7%. Se ci si fermasse a questo indicatore, il Nord apparirebbe sostanzialmente al riparo. 

Ma la seconda misura - la dispersione implicita - racconta un quadro più articolato. Secondo la definizione Invalsi, è «disperso implicito» lo studente che, al termine della secondaria di secondo grado, non raggiunge contemporaneamente almeno il livello 3 in italiano e in matematica e il livello B1 nelle prove di inglese: un diplomato che non possiede le competenze minime per affrontare studio, lavoro e cittadinanza attiva. «Attualmente - spiega Roberto Ricci, presidente di Invalsi - la fragilità educativa è influenzata dal contesto socio-economico-culturale di provenienza. Nonostante gli sforzi, la trasmissione sociale di questa fragilità rimane un problema irrisolto». 

Nel 2023 la dispersione implicita nazionale era pari all’8,7%. In Piemonte il 3,4%, segnalando una buona performance media del sistema regionale. Tuttavia, restringendo lo sguardo al comune di Torino, uno studio Invalsi rileva che la quota sale al 10,4%, superando la media italiana. Ancora più marcata è la differenza se si osservano le aree urbane attraverso un indicatore socio-economico come il valore medio al metro quadro degli immobili: nelle periferie con valori più bassi la dispersione implicita media cresce e raggiunge il 24%, con punte oltre il 50; nelle zone più benestanti si colloca poco sopra l’1%. In altre parole, all’interno della stessa città coesistono scuole dove quasi tutti raggiungono le soglie minime e scuole dove fino a un diplomato su quattro non le raggiunge. 

Una dinamica simile si osserva in altre grandi aree metropolitane del Nord, dove le medie regionali positive convivono con forti squilibri tra quartieri centrali e periferici. Il risultato è che il Nord presenta tassi di abbandono formale più contenuti rispetto al Sud, ma non è immune da una quota significativa di studenti che completano il percorso senza consolidare le competenze di base. «I casi di Milano e di Torino - aggiunge Ricci - mostrano la necessità di nuove categorie di analisi che superino in chiave moderna alcune tradizionali distinzioni come quella tra contesti urbani e rurali». 

C’è anche un altro aspetto che fa la differenza, il background migratorio: «Tra questi studenti, i numeri di chi abbandona precocemente gli studi sono triplicati» spiega Caterina Corapi, fondatrice e direttrice di Next Level, ente del terzo settore torinese che si occupa di progetti dedicati all’inclusione giovanile. «In questi anni ci siamo concentrati su un lavoro di empowerment sia degli insegnanti che delle scuole con cui operiamo. Dai progetti che sviluppiamo con loro emerge l’enorme potenziale dei ragazzi che però partono svantaggiati. Stiamo rischiando di perdere questo capitale perché la dispersione implicita è correlata al rischio di Neet», aggiunge Corapi. Le due forme di dispersione non sono fenomeni separati. Quella esplicita rappresenta l’uscita visibile dal sistema. 

Quella implicita è una fragilità che si manifesta più tardi, nel mercato del lavoro o nell’accesso all’istruzione terziaria. In entrambi i casi, il livello di istruzione incide direttamente sulle opportunità occupazionali: tra i 25 e i 64 anni il tasso di occupazione è intorno al 55% per chi possiede al massimo la licenza media e sale fino all’85% per chi ha un titolo terziario. In un contesto demografico segnato dall’invecchiamento e dalla riduzione della popolazione giovane, ogni punto percentuale di dispersione pesa di più.

""Ciò che Trump offre è una via di fuga facile dal dolore. Le sue promesse sono l’ago nella vena collettiva dell’America. Lui è eroina culturale. Fa sentire alcuni meglio per un po’. Ma non sa sistemare ciò che li affligge, e un giorno lo capiranno».

JD Vance (Atlantic Magazine, 4 luglio 2016)


Monaco, conferenza internazionale per la sicurezza. Ascoltavo affascinato il cancelliere tedesco Friederich Merz prendere radicalmente le distanze dal mondo Maga (Make America Great Again), dunque da Donald Trump, JD Vance, Peter Thiel e persino dall’ormai marginale, ma pur sempre aggressivo Steve Bannon, e mi chiedevo quale sarebbe stata la reazione di Giorgia Meloni che, appena ventiquattro ore prima, aveva annunciato al mondo la costruzione di un sorprendente asse Roma-Berlino (absit iniuria verbis), pensato per creare, dirigere ed esaltare una nuova, illuminata, strategia Mega, Make Europe Great Again. Loro sono forti, ma anche noi non scherziamo.

L’America ci considera parassiti, ci schiaccia con i dazi, reclama la Groenlandia, strizza l’occhio a Putin e manda l’Ice in strada a rastrellare gli immigrati e a sparare in testa ai propri concittadini di Minneapolis?

Noi democrazie liberali del Vecchio Continente, forti delle atomiche di Parigi e Londra e di un mercato che solo nell’Unione raduna quasi quattrocentocinquanta milioni di esseri umani, dichiariamo la nostra estraneità a questo modo di agire e al supposto universo valoriale che lo sostiene. La violenza della Casa Bianca, amplificata dall’ossessione per il dominio delle Big Tech guidate da Palantir, non farà mai parte della nostra idea delle relazioni internazionali. Eccola qua la posizione di Merz. E, si supponeva, anche nostra. Errore.

Impegnata in Africa per il Piano Mattei (forse la cosa migliore studiata dal suo governo), la Presidente del Consiglio, nel giro di ventiquattro ore, ha pensato bene di chiarire il suo pensiero: Merz sbaglia, Trump ha ragione. Testualmente: «Non condivido le critiche di Merz al mondo Maga». A lei, gli ultranazionalisti bianchi piacciono. Scaricato il Cancelliere, bye bye asse Roma-Berlino. Difficile stupirsi se l’Europa sarà ancora una volta a trazione franco-tedesca.

Non paga, la Presidente ha annunciato che l’Italia parteciperà come «osservatrice» al Board of Peace, allegra organizzazione privata di dittatorelli orientali, desiderosi di dar vita ad una strampalata Onu parallela e di trasformare quel che resta di Gaza nella spettacolare Hollywood sul Mediterraneo. Domanda: perché da osservatore e non da azionista diretto? Le risposte sono due. La prima: la nostra Costituzione glielo vieta, ma la premier non ha resistito alla tentazione di schierarsi con l’immobiliarista di Mar-a-Lago, chissà che non ci scappino un paio di grattacieli anche per noi. La seconda: nonostante la plateale sintonia con Trump e con il trumpismo, Palazzo Chigi continua a fingere di condividere il destino di Bruxelles, nella speranza che le cancellerie confinanti siano cieche e sorde. Se il fato ci avesse assegnato il territorio canadese al posto del nostro meraviglioso Stivale, oggi saremmo orgogliosamente il cinquantunesimo Stato americano. A salvarci ci ha pensato l’Oceano. Per ora.

Convinti che Meloni avesse la forza di gestire gli incomprensibili umori variabili dell’irascibile Tycoon, abbiamo scoperto che è invece l’ottantenne presidente americano ad orientare lei, unica leader europea ad evitare da tre anni la Conferenza di Monaco, dove sarebbe costretta a spiegare ufficialmente quale ruolo intendiamo giocare sullo scacchiere del mondo, e a snobbare anche l’incontro delle élite globali a Davos. Trump era lì, il Board of Peace era lì. Lei no. Sarebbe stata una brutta fotografia da restituire ad un Paese, il nostro, in cui – come testimonia un sondaggio di Alessandra Ghisleri – sette elettori su dieci detestano il Caro Presidente Donald.

In questo scenario senza né capo né coda, ripensavo a Piero Gobetti. Al fascismo come autobiografia della nazione. Alla sua avversione per il «giolittismo», cioè per il regime del compromesso, per il voltagabbanismo, per il salto istintivo sul carro del vincitore, per il tentennamento da «vediamo dove soffia il vento». È morto domani, esattamente cent’anni fa. Aveva venticinque anni, ma era un tipo di leader cristallino e inflessibile che oggi non abbiamo. Non mi sembra un caso che il presidente Mattarella partecipi qui a Torino alle sue celebrazioni.

Rigore, coerenza, valori. Merce di seconda mano per un governo ormai certo che qualunque passo esplicito per uscire dall’ambiguità produca un danno elettorale. Meglio il piccolo cabotaggio che ti garantisce cinque anni di potere ulteriore, di un vincolo strategico che ti mette al centro del progetto europeo con il rischio di perdere una quota, per quanto risibile, di consenso interno. Fa impressione pensare che le destre continentali, dopo averci spiegato per decenni che Bruxelles era lenta e incapace di decollare a causa di pastoie burocratiche e interessi di bottega, oggi siano la sabbia di un motore che Berlino, Parigi, persino Londra, e si sperava Roma, hanno finalmente acceso. Meloni si è lasciata scappare il suo momento Churchill, giurando fedeltà a The Donald, lo stesso uomo che, nel 2016, JD Vance raccontava così: «Ciò che Trump offre è una via di fuga facile dal dolore. Le sue promesse sono l’ago nella vena collettiva dell’America. Lui è eroina culturale. 

Fa sentire alcuni meglio per un po’. Ma non sa sistemare ciò che li affligge, e un giorno lo capiranno». Quel giorno è ancora lontano, Vance si è convertito sulla strada lastricata d’oro che porta al 1600 di Pennsylvania Avenue e Giorgia Meloni ha sposato assieme a lui la religione Maga. Un culto che l’intelligenza artificiale del mio computer fotografa con questa neutra chiarezza: «Antiglobalismo, eurofobia, protezionismo economico, lotta alle energie rinnovabili, remigrazione, disprezzo per le élite liberali, per le Università e i media tradizionali». Il movimento, mi spiega ancora l’Ai, si avvale di una vasta rete di influencer e podcaster della “manosphere”, crasi tra le parole “man”, uomo, e “sphere”, sfera. Neologismo che identifica i paladini del machismo in lotta perenne contro il femminismo. Naturalmente America First. Come non sognare di finire tra le braccia di questi stravaganti squinternati?

Capace di tenere a bada lo scomposto Salvini e di disinnescare, per il momento, il Generale Vannacci, grazie ad una capacità politica superiore, la premier rischia di scivolare però sul referendum di marzo, sempre più simile a una consultazione su di lei, e sull’imperdonabile subalternità al Monarca americano ormai impossibile da nascondere. Nessuno è in grado di giocare tutte le parti in commedia, neppure lei. Il Cancelliere Merz si rifiuta di passare alla Storia come un nuovo Paul von Hindeburg, Feldmaresciallo e presidente della Germania che consegnò il potere a Hitler. E la durezza delle sue dichiarazioni ha spinto il Segretario di Stato americano Mark Rubio ad abbassare i toni e a giurare una posticcia fedeltà a noi vecchi alleati. Dimostrazione che perdendo la dignità si perde automaticamente la battaglia politica.

Giorgia Meloni sembra avere risolto il dilemma in modo opposto, fiera del suo rapporto con Trump come Cervantes lo fu del suo braccio paralizzato e Beethoven della sua sordità. Sostegno senza se e con pochi ma ai Nuovi Stati Uniti degli Orchi, un Paese dominato da un’élite trasversale che si sente al di sopra della legge e che ha prodotto lo sconvolgente scandalo Epstein, un abisso fatto di ricatti, torture e pedofilia. Un mondo marcio, ricchissimo e buio, in cui le Big Tech si fanno Big State, manipolato dai servizi segreti di più Paesi, costruito attorno alle penose debolezze e ai deliri di onnipotenza degli uomini più in vista della Terra. Davvero le piacciono queste élite, davvero le piace questa America, davvero è disposta a lasciar naufragare l’Europa in nome dei principi Maga, davvero non è in grado di interrompere questa lunga camminata nel giardino del suo orgoglio?

- customer focus (critically identify gaps in technologies for customer exp)
- learning new technologies: agentic workflows (good example of deep dive)
- hiring and mentoring (50 interviews wait no senior? interns..)

""Think about a time you encountered something unfamiliar at work""
- new tech 6 months ago, attended tech talks about agentic workflows
- brainstormed how they could use it for their team
- it's very different from traditional backend REST API calls
- it's a streaming model, it takes a lot longer to run these models, tinkered with test apps on bedrock
- met with senior engineers to learn more about the workflows, document them for the team

""what project are you most proud of""
- on the same track, I've built a ticket auto-triage tool
- I'm not really sure what they said, but eventually they got to outcomes (reducing time to triage)
- still not clear why they are proud of this, feels like they're just giving me a project report
  - instead of highlighting ""this is how *I* grew from this""
- cost savings projection -> design doc -> iterative development process -> orchestrated 3 engineers
- something about obs, mcp servers, logging, swarm, linear workflows, local development, metrics, graph db...
- getting way too far into the tech without me asking.
- clearly has technical depth, focus on metrics + customer experience, seems like they could have high ownership
- finally identified the shortcomings of overengineering

""Why is overengineering bad""
- didn't answer my question at first
- creating or using unnecessary files
- building fragility into the infrastructure
- example: agentic workflow addressing the problem of placeholder data - only affected one type of component/carousel

""how did you grow from this project?""
- new model of monitoring nondeterministic workflows - model latency, i/o token size
- optimizing prompts is directly correlated with team costs and quality of output
- context management - swarm digging into a deep ticket can ruin its context. there's different approaches here

""You realize your team is sacrificing security/reliability to release a product, how do you bring this up""
- would raise a flag in the doc review, focus on the requirement for scale, is aligned with security guidelines, etc
- these are questions I've added to our team's docs infra myself
- would make sure these are known by the DRI engineers
- would expect that the proposed product has rigorous backup behavior
- would make sure that new services follow golden path recommendations by default
- notably - no talk about how to resolve this after-the-fact
- irl story: they found a service that skipped launch readiness for his service (? lol)
- and worked with them to resolve, make sure they're ready for company-wide load tests
- why was this skipped in the first place? the web engs were new, subject to churn, unaware... and silo'd.

""Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone""
- met with some senior engs to understand perspective on whats blocking engs building features e2e with ai tooling
- prime video put together ""ai native framework"" but there were q's around what is this actually good at? (lol)
- colleague wanted to pilot ai native framework for a brownfield project, whereas they felt like it's better for greenfield
- team met to decide they will put the 2 in the ring... duke it out... other engineer got tilted and refused to scope down
- therapized the other guy, ultimately demo'd 2 cool projects to the team

meta points
- not bad, but meanders around the point until they eventually get to outcomes
- really just has one story
- impact seems team-scoped
- issue with vocabulary - 'legacy' preferred over ""blah blah 3 months 6 months engineers no longer here archaic...""
- needs to focus on the story they're telling, continually engage me - ""I can expand on that if you want, but that's the gist""
- seniors are capable of taking a step back and translating tech to english
- comes off as high-energy mid level"

Le autorità cubane hanno annunciato che è finito il combustibile per i voli commerciali. Alcune compagnie aeree li hanno già sospesi e vari alberghi hanno chiuso

di Carlos Salinas Maldonado, El País América, Messico


La crisi economica che Cuba sta vivendo a causa della carenza di petrolio e quindi dell’impossibilità di generare energia elettrica continua ad avere conseguenze gravi: l’8 febbraio il governo ha comunicato alle compagnie aeree internazionali che il paese non ha più combustibile per l’aviazione. Il settore più colpito è quello del turismo, una delle principali fonti di guadagno per L’Avana. Le autorità attribuiscono la carenza di diesel e di altri combustibili all’asfissia imposta dagli Stati Uniti, che hanno minacciato dazi contro chi invia petrolio all’isola. 

Senza fornire ulteriori dettagli, la Russia ha detto che cercherà di aiutare il suo alleato. L’agenzia Efe ha riferito che le compagnie aeree internazionali sono state avvertite della mancanza di carburante solo l’8 febbraio. Secondo l’agenzia di stampa, le compagnie più penalizzate sono quelle statunitensi, spagnole, panamensi e messicane. Il giorno prima il governo cubano aveva chiuso gli alberghi ricollocando i turisti stranieri. Il turismo è un pilastro per la debilitata economia cubana, perché porta soldi e lavoro in un contesto in cui le risorse scarseggiano. 

Nel 2024 l’isola ha accolto circa 2,2 milioni di turisti, la cifra più bassa in quasi due decenni e inferiore alle aspettative ufficiali. I dati dell’Oficina nacional de estadística e información, l’ufficio cubano di statistica, mostrano che tra gennaio e settembre 2025 i visitatori stranieri sono diminuiti del 20,5 per cento, arrivando ad appena 1.366.720, ossia 350mila in meno rispetto all’anno precedente. Il calo non colpisce solo gli alberghi e i servizi del settore, ma genera tensione nelle fragili finanze pubbliche e riduce il necessario afflusso di valuta estera. Il vicepremier cubano, Oscar Pérez-Oliva Fraga, il 6 febbraio ha confermato lo sviluppo di un piano per “ridurre i consumi energetici, compattare le strutture turistiche e riuscire a sfruttare il periodo dell’alta stagione”.

Disposti al dialogo 
Da quando il presidente statunitense Donald Trump ha aumentato la pressione sull’Avana, il governo ha adottato misure severe per affrontare la crisi. Il 29 gennaio Trump ha firmato un ordine che minaccia dazi contro tutti i paesi che vogliono portare petrolio a Cuba. Dopo l’intervento militare statunitense a Caracas il 3 gennaio per catturare il presidente Nicolás Maduro e sua moglie Cilia Flores, Cuba ha smesso di ricevere petrolio dal Venezuela, che era il suo principale fornitore. Anche il Messico ha sospeso l’invio di petrolio per paura dei dazi statunitensi. 

“Siamo impegnati a livello diplomatico per poter ricominciare a mandare greggio a Cuba. Ovviamente non vogliamo che ci siano sanzioni per il Messico, ma siamo in fase di trattative e per ora invieremo aiuti umanitari”, ha detto la presidente Claudia Sheinbaum. Il 5 febbraio il presidente cubano Miguel Díaz-Canel si è detto disposto ad aprire un dialogo con Washington se avviene in condizioni paritarie e senza pressioni, una mossa che dimostra la disperazione del governo di fronte alla crisi. Díaz-Canel ha ammesso che “l’asfissia economica della principale potenza mondiale” pesa sulla già grave situazione dell’isola. 

Per questo nei prossimi giorni ci saranno dei tagli simili a quelli del cosiddetto periodo speciale, dopo il crollo dell’Unione Sovietica negli anni novanta. “La persecuzione energetica e finanziaria, e l’inasprimento delle misure coercitive è così forte che per superare tutti gli ostacoli sappiamo di dover lavorare molto duramente, in modo molto creativo e molto intelligente”, ha detto Díaz-Canel.In attesa di conoscere tutte le nuove misure, i cubani affrontano lunghe code per recuperare un po’ di carburante nelle stazioni di servizio e fanno scorta di cibo in scatola nei negozi. Il governo ha annunciato modifiche agli orari di lavoro, telelavoro per i dipendenti pubblici, meno lezioni in presenza nelle scuole e nelle università e la cancellazione di eventi culturali importanti come la fiera internazionale del libro dell’Avana, che avrebbe dovuto svolgersi dal 12 al 22 febbraio. 

Sostegno russo 
Il 9 febbraio il portavoce del Cremlino Dmitrij Peskov ha reso noto che la Russia sta cercando delle soluzioni insieme alle autorità cubane e che farà il possibile per aiutarle in questo momento critico, oltre a facilitare il rientro dei turisti russi che potrebbero rimanere bloccati sull’isola. “Manteniamo intensi contatti con gli amici cubani sia attraverso canali diplomatici sia per altre vie”, ha dichiarato Peskov in conferenza stampa. “Queste misure soffocanti da parte degli Stati Uniti creano davvero grandi difficoltà al paese”, ha sottolineato il portavoce, assicurando che Mosca e L’Avana stanno studiando “modi per risolvere questi problemi o, almeno, attenuarli”. Secondo il servizio stampa dell’unione dell’industria turistica russa, in questo momento a Cuba ci sono circa quattromila turisti russi.

Aiuti umanitari dal Messico
 Il governo della presidente messicana Claudia Sheinbaum (di centrosinistra) ha annunciato l’8 febbraio che due navi con a bordo più di ottocento tonnellate di generi alimentari (tra cui latte in polvere) e altri prodotti per l’igiene personale sono partite dal porto di Veracruz dirette a Cuba. È un segno di solidarietà verso il paese caraibico, che sta soffrendo una grave crisi da quando non riceve più il petrolio dal Venezuela, dopo la cattura del presidente Nicolás Maduro il 3 gennaio da parte degli Stati Uniti. Il Messico ha anche reso noto che sta cercando il modo di riprendere la fornitura di greggio all’Avana senza incorrere nei dazi minacciati dagli Stati Uniti. In conferenza stampa Sheinbaum ha ricordato che i blocchi e le sanzioni economiche colpiscono soprattutto i civili e che, “indipendentemente dal fatto che si sia d’accordo o meno con il governo cubano, non si può mettere in ginocchio in questo modo una popolazione”.
