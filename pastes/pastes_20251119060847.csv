IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).

Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)

Don't be mistaken though, this is more of a light than an actual book, as the pages are all glued together. So don't be surprised if you can't seem to 'open' it. The book relies on magnets to ensures it stays shut and fully open. I was really amazed that opening and closing the book is how it turns on and off the light, a very cool way to do that. What didn't amaze me though is the battery life, it is very short. So you'll likely have to charge it very frequently. I'd recommend a magnetic tip charging cable for ease of use.\n\n🟣  ＣＯＮＣＬＵＳＩＯＮ\nThis made a great addition to my cozy Christmas setup. Love it! "",
