IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).

Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)

xKQLGd7i,Amazon Product: 160GB MP3 Player with Bluetooth 50 and WiFi — REVIEW — B0FSD4S9XM,NeonHD,JSON,Tuesday 25th of November 2025 06:18:24 PM CDT,"{
  ""reviewBody"": ""🟡 ＰＲＥＡＭＢＬＥ\nHowdy everyone! Today I will be taking a look at the Globluum SU9, a cute little Android-based DAP that was designed for kids. And honestly, considering this is in fact a full-fledged Android device, your kids will be doing much more things on here other than music (if parental controls aren't in place). Thus, I will mainly be covering this DAP/MP3 Player from an adult's perspective, more specifically from someone who is an audiophile themselves. I own quite a few DAPs and have a collection of IEMs to try this with, so rest assured I will be doing a lot of listening and A/Bing.\n\n[𝙻𝚎𝚝'𝚜 𝚐𝚎𝚝 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚛𝚝𝚎𝚍]\n\n🟢  ＰＲＯＳ\n➜ ACTUALLY GOOD SOUND!! 🤯\n➜ \n➜ Included 128GB microSD is no joke 😮\n➜ The bootloader can, in fact, be unlocked... 👀\n\n🔴  ＣＯＮＳ\n➜ Some preloaded apps are questionable for kids (ahem—X)\n➜ Navigation buttons can be a bit confusing\n➜ \n\n\n🔵  ＭＹ ＴＨＯＵＧＨＴＳ\n\n𝗕𝗨𝗜𝗟𝗗 𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗬\nThis device looked like it came straight out of 2016, and then got blasted with a shrink ray. It's basically a miniatured phone from yesteryears. Not that that's bad or anything. Removing the pre-applied clear case and screen protector reveals a matte plastic back, along with a front display made of 2.5D glass. The glass likely offers no scratch resistance or oleophobic coating, but I'm just glad it's glass and not a plastic screen. Overall I couldn't really ask for more, it's meant for kids anyway, and it's far from the cheapest built device.\n\n𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬\nThis device has a low-resolution unlaminated LCD display of 800ｘ480 pixels. So texts will be noticeably pixelated, however it's actually not too bad considering the tiny size of the display. Despite being unlaminated, the air gap between the glass and LCD is quite thin, so it's not the worst I've seen in that regard.\n\n𝗗𝗘𝗦𝗜𝗚𝗡\nOverall design-wise, I like it! I like how tiny it is, and the light pink colorway is really cute. The white glass front reminds me of phones from 10-15 years ago, which is a nice nostalgic feeling.\n\n𝗦𝗢𝗙𝗧𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗘\nAs with most cheap Android devices, the Globluum SU9 runs on fairly a minimal build of AOSP. The ROM does include quite a fair bit of pre-installed apps, but they can all be uninstalled. The homescreen icons all have a consistent playful cartoonish design to them, which I think is quite nice. But if you or your kid is ever tired of them, I'd recommend installing other launchers so you're not confined to a single immutable UI.\n\n𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗙𝗢𝗥𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘\nApparently this MP3 player is equipped with the Mediatek Helio A22 chipset. This is a common chipset found in many low-end phones from 2018-2022. It's pretty subpar in today's standards, but it's still far from the worst that I've seen. The Helio A22 is comparable to something like the Snapdragon 430. I'm just lucky that it didn't use some garbage chip from the likes of Unisoc/spreadtrum. It is then further bolstered with 3 Gigs of RAM, so not too shabby.\n\n\n\n🟣  ＣＯＮＣＬＵＳＩＯＮ\nGlobluum really went above and beyond with this MP3 player that was intended for kids. Deliberate thought and effort was put into making this product. General performance turned out to be better than expected. The sound output actually turned out to be very decent, and the included earphones actually didn't suck! \n\nUsually when you hear about a ‘kids’ product, you expect it to be pretty bad for adults, let alone for kids. Well this isn't the case here. To my discerning eye and ears, this is a great MP3 player in and of itself, especially at this price point. Any child who receives such a player will certainly be in for a treat. Is it one of the best sounding DAPs out there? Hell no. But for a kids device, it's more than what I could ask for."",

IMPORTANT: Do not use it for transactions LARGER THAN $15,000!!! If you exceed that amount, they will ask for your ID and hold your swap until your identity is verified - and we dont want that. Personally I have been doing multiple $15,000 swaps so far, and worked just fine (none of them triggered KYC/AML checks).

Also remember to wait at least 1 hour after successful transaction if you want to use it again. (It also prevents AML checks - you can even wait longer if u wanna be sure)
