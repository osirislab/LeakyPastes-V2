1. Use the time zone glitch to get free stuff:
 
Guide PDF: https://lc.cx/jSVEeR
 
2. Go to Paxful
3. Find buyers that buy them without physical receipt.
4. They pay about 60-70% of the codes value, normally u would say it's a bad deal, but since u got them for free u actually make easy and instant $$.
 
If u don't wanna sell them, u could actually just redeem them yourself, but personally I prefer to make money, but it's up to you.

U6YdETWz,triangle skript,worstbull,Linden Scripting,Friday 28th of February 2025 10:06:26 AM CDT,"Hier ist dein korrigiertes und überarbeitetes Skript, welches nun eindeutig ein Dreieck zwischen den drei Bällen spannt:

### Erklärung der Änderungen:

- Ich habe festgestellt, dass die ursprüngliche Version ""Kanten"" korrekt positioniert, aber die eigentliche Fläche des Dreiecks (PRIM_TRIANGLE) nicht berücksichtigt/gesetzt hat.
- Ein sichtbares Dreieck zwischen drei Punkten kann mittels des Typs ""PRIM_TYPE_PRISM"" oder speziell ""PRIM_TYPE_SCULPT"" nicht ordentlich erzeugt werden, da Second Life keine direkte Fläche zwischen drei Punkten bereitstellt. Standardmäßig gibt es keinen primitiven Typ, der ein Dreieck direkt zwischen drei frei platzierbaren Punkten erzeugt.
- Die beste Möglichkeit, das gewünschte Ergebnis zu erhalten, ist, den PRIM_TYPE entsprechend scalieren, positionieren und rotieren (normalerweise mit einer flachen Prim ""PRIM_TYPE_PRISM"" oder ""PRIM_TYPE_BOX"") und per Rotation genau auf die drei Punkte auszurichten. Beispielsweise kannst du eine flache Box (Plane) nutzen und per Transformation exakt zwischen den drei Bällen ausrichten und skalieren.

Da Second Life Standard-Prims keine echte dreipunktbasierte Transformation erlauben, empfehle ich folgendes einfache Verfahren:

### Vorgeschlagene funktionierende Lösung:  
Verwende ein dünnes Dreieck (flacher Prism), das standardmäßig eine Dreiecksform hat — und positioniere, rotiere und skaliere dieses zwischen den drei Punkten.

### Korrigiertes vollständiges Skript (benutzt PRISM Typ als Dreiecksfläche):

    timer() {
        update();    
    }
}
```

### Wichtige Hinweise zum Setup in Second Life:

- Bitte stelle sicher:
   - Link-Nummern: 2,3,4 sind ""Kanten"" (z.B. dünne Zylinderprims)
   - Link-Nummern: 5,6,7 sind ""Bälle"", deren Positionen das Dreieck bestimmen  
   - Link-Nummer: 8 ist eine flache Prismaform (Setze auf ""PRISM"", flach (Z-Size sehr klein), idealerweise Textur auf 100% Transparent oder eine sichtbare Farbe).
- Positioniere und rotiere das PRISM ursprünglich ausgerichtet wie du willst. Das Skript übernimmt dann kontinuierlich das exakte Anpassen der Position, Größe und Rotation.

Jetzt sollte das Dreieck korrekt zwischen den drei angegebenen Punkten aufgespannt werden!"
