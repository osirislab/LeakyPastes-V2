dPxvRtBv,Clock Instructions,DamagedDolphin,Python,Saturday 28th of December 2024 10:46:27 PM CDT,"Guide for Setting Up and Running the Analog Voltmeter Clock

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Analog Voltmeter Clock using a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Adafruit PWM/Servo Bonnet, and analog voltmeters for hours, minutes, and seconds.
Required Components

    Analog Voltmeter (x3)
    DC 62T2/65C5 3V Class 2.5 Analog Voltmeter
    URL: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832716993909.html

    PWM/Servo Controller
    Adafruit 16-Channel PWM/Servo Bonnet for Raspberry Pi
    URL: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3416

    Microcontroller
    Raspberry Pi Zero W
    URL: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/

    Optional: PiSugar Battery Pack
    PiSugar 2 for Raspberry Pi Zero W
    URL: https://www.tindie.com/products/pisugar/pisugar-2-battery-for-raspberry-pi-zero/

    Miscellaneous Components
        Micro-USB cable and power adapter.
        Soldering iron (if headers need to be soldered onto the Raspberry Pi or PWM bonnet).

Wiring Configuration

    Connect the PWM Bonnet to the Raspberry Pi
        Align the 40-pin GPIO header on the Adafruit PWM/Servo Bonnet with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Push down firmly.

    Connect the Voltmeters to the PWM Bonnet
    Assign each voltmeter to a specific PWM channel:
        Seconds Needle (clockSeconds): PWM Channel 2
        Minutes Needle (clockMinutes): PWM Channel 1
        Hours Needle (clockHours): PWM Channel 0

    Wiring details for each voltmeter:
        GND Pin: Connect to the GND terminal of the PWM bonnet.
        VCC Pin: Connect to the respective PWM channel terminal.

    Power Supply
        Use a micro-USB cable and power adapter to supply power to the Raspberry Pi and PWM Bonnet.

    Optional: PiSugar RTC Battery Pack
        Attach the PiSugar 2 battery pack to the Raspberry Pi Zero W to enable portable power and real-time clock functionality.

Software Setup
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS

    Flash Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Desktop) onto an SD card using a tool like Balena Etcher.
    Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and boot it up.

2. Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi

    Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:

sudo raspi-config

Navigate to Interface Options > I2C and enable it.
Reboot the Raspberry Pi:

    sudo reboot

3. Install Required Python Libraries

    Update and install Python 3 and pip:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip -y

Install the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries:

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685

Running the Clock Software

    Download the Clock Code
    Save the provided Python code as clock.py in the directory /home/pi/.

    Calibrate the Voltmeters
        Before running the clock, calibrate the voltmeters to ensure accurate positioning of the needles.
        Run the calibration mode:

    python3 clock.py --calibrate

    Follow the on-screen instructions to fine-tune the PWM values for each step (hours, minutes, seconds). Calibration data will be saved to calibration_data.json.

Run the Clock

    Once calibrated, start the clock:

        python3 clock.py

How the Code Works
Key Components

    PWM Channels for Voltmeters:
        clockSeconds: Controls the seconds needle (PWM Channel 2).
        clockMinutes: Controls the minutes needle (PWM Channel 1).
        clockHours: Controls the hours needle (PWM Channel 0).

    Calibration (--calibrate):
        The program adjusts the PWM values for specific positions of the voltmeter needles (e.g., 0, 10, 20, etc.).
        Calibration data is saved in calibration_data.json.

    Time Interpolation:
        The interpolate_pwm function calculates intermediate PWM values for fractional times (e.g., 10:30:45).

    Smooth Transitions:
        The move_needle_smoothly function ensures the voltmeter needles move smoothly between positions.

Code Structure

# Initialization:
i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
hat = adafruit_pca9685.PCA9685(i2c)
hat.frequency = 60

# Assign channels:
clockSeconds = hat.channels[2]
clockMinutes = hat.channels[1]
clockHours = hat.channels[0]

# Calibration:
python3 clock.py --calibrate

# Clock Execution:
python3 clock.py

Adding the Clock to Startup

To run the clock automatically on boot:

    Create a Systemd Service

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/analog-clock.service

Service Configuration Add the following to the file:

[Unit]
Description=Analog Voltmeter Clock
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/clock.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Enable the Service

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable analog-clock.service
sudo systemctl start analog-clock.service

Check Service Status

    sudo systemctl status analog-clock.service

Troubleshooting

    No Calibration File Found: Run python3 clock.py --calibrate to create one.
    PWM Not Working: Verify the I2C connection with:

    sudo i2cdetect -y 1
