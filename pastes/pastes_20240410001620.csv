 * This class will handle variable surcharges based on event duration and extra charges based on form field.
 *
 * The first charge is based on number of spaces booked and hours of the event, this will automatically be applied to all events, modify $variant and $variant name to change the surcharge price and name.
 *
 * The second charge will come into effect if you create a custom booking form field with the id 'extra_charge' (or the name of $extra_field_id if you modify it) and will add a fixed amount to the booking.
 * If the field is a dropdown or anything that has a numeric value, that will be multipled by the $extra_cost field. If a checkbox, then $extra_cost will be applied.
 *
 * To install, download the contents of this snippet into a file with .php extension, and save it to your /wp-content/mu-plugins folder (create if necessary).
